# Sibyl Claude Code Hooks

Automatic integration between Sibyl and Claude Code.

## Install

```bash
moon run hooks:install
```

Then restart Claude Code.

## What It Does

| Hook             | Trigger        | Action                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SessionStart** | Session begins | Prints the current session bundle and next-step reminder |

The per-prompt context-injection hook (`UserPromptSubmit`) was removed because it
substituted for the `sibyl` skill instead of nudging the agent to load it. Agents
should invoke the skill on their own and call `sibyl recall` / `sibyl context pack`
when they need working memory. Re-running `sibyl local setup` cleans the legacy
hook out of `~/.claude/settings.json` and removes the orphan script from
`~/.claude/hooks/sibyl/`.

## Uninstall

```bash
moon run hooks:uninstall
```

Or manually: `rm -rf ~/.claude/hooks/sibyl`

## Files

- `session-start.py` - Prints the session bundle (active tasks, recent memory, next step)
- `configure.py` - Registers the SessionStart hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`, preserving any non-Sibyl hooks already present
