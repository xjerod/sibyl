"""Contradiction detection for knowledge ingest.

Detects potential conflicts when adding new knowledge by:
1. Finding semantically similar existing entities
2. Classifying conflicts (duplicate, overlap, contradiction)
3. Optionally using LLM for nuanced contradiction analysis

This layer helps maintain knowledge graph consistency by warning
about conflicting information before it's added.
