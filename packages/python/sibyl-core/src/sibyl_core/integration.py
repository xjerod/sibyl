AGENT_PROMPT_SNIPPET = """## Sibyl - Your Persistent Memory

Sibyl is your durable memory across sessions. It is a knowledge graph of
decisions, patterns, tasks, and learnings. Reach it through the `sibyl` CLI or
the Sibyl MCP tools, whichever your setup has.

### Session start (MANDATORY)

If your client supports skills, invoke the `sibyl` skill immediately at session
start. The skill points at the version-matched CLI guidance and the current task
queue. Without skill support, run `sibyl context` to confirm the project link
and `sibyl task list --status doing` to see active work before anything else.

### The memory loop: recall, act, remember, reflect

1. **Recall** working context before you act. A past session may have solved this.
   CLI: `sibyl recall "<goal>" --intent build`. MCP: the `search` and `context` tools.
2. **Act** with that context in hand. Use IDs from recall with
   `sibyl show <id>` when a preview is not enough.
3. **Remember** durable knowledge as you learn it: decisions, gotchas, patterns.
   The next session should not have to rediscover it.
   CLI: `sibyl remember "Title" "What matters" --kind decision`. MCP: the `remember` tool.
4. **Reflect** at clean breakpoints to distill session notes into reviewable memory.
   CLI: `sibyl reflect "<notes>" --persist`. MCP: the `reflect` tool.

### Intent -> verb bridges

Recognize these prompt shapes and reach for the verb, not the file system:

- "what am I working on" / "current tasks" -> `sibyl task list --status doing,blocked`
- "where did I leave off" / "pick up from yesterday" -> `sibyl recall "<goal>"`
- "have we hit this before" / "what's our pattern for X" -> `sibyl search "<topic>"`
  first; only `sibyl show <id>` after you have an ID from search or recall
- "remember this" / "write this up" / "save this insight" / "we just learned X" -> `sibyl remember`
- "consolidate this session" / "wrap up" / "save this session for next time" -> `sibyl reflect "<notes>" --persist`
- "show me the full content" -> `sibyl show <id>`
- "what's the deal with X" / "X was mentioned" / "tell me about Y" -> `sibyl search "<X>"` before answering
- "complete this task: <learning>" without an explicit task id -> `sibyl task list -q "<topic>"` once, then `sibyl task complete <id> --learnings "..."`

If the natural-language ask sounds like memory work, it is memory work. Don't
default to `Write` for "write up what we learned"; that's `sibyl remember`. Don't
burn turns hunting for an entity by listing or showing unrelated records; `sibyl
search` and `sibyl recall` are how you discover IDs.

### What to capture

**Always:** non-obvious solutions, gotchas, config quirks, architectural decisions.
**Skip:** trivial facts, throwaway hacks, well-documented basics.

Make each memory findable and reusable later:

- Weak: "Fixed the auth bug."
- Strong: "JWT refresh fails silently when the Redis TTL expires. The token
  service does not handle WRONGTYPE. Fix: regenerate the token on that error."

If your client supports skills (Claude Code, Codex), run `/sibyl` for the full
command reference. Otherwise `sibyl --help` covers it. Run `sibyl doctor` at any
time to verify the recommended agent setup is in place.
