## 🔮 Why Sibyl

Persistent memory for your projects, tasks, and research. A collective intelligence
that compounds with every session and makes your graph more useful over time.

Most coding sessions start cold. No memory of what worked, what failed, or what you
learned yesterday. Notes drift. Tasks scatter. Useful context disappears.

**Sibyl changes that.**

A SurrealDB-native knowledge graph gives your work durable memory. Epics and tasks
structure execution. A built-in agent memory loop (`recall → act → remember → reflect`)
keeps hard-won context close at hand for humans and AI tools alike. Source-grounded
synthesis turns what you already know into verified documents.

**The whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.**

## ✦ What You Get

| Capability | What It Means |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 🔮 **Collective Intelligence** | Every session compounds. The graph gets smarter as your team and tools capture real work |
| 🪄 **The Memory Loop** | `recall → act → remember → reflect` is built into the CLI, MCP, and hooks. Agents wake up with context and leave it behind |
| 🎯 **Semantic Search** | Find knowledge by meaning. "Authentication patterns" finds OAuth solutions even when "OAuth" isn't in the text |
| 🦋 **Task Workflow** | Plan with epics and tasks. Track execution across sessions and teammates in one place |
| 🧪 **Source-Grounded Synthesis** | Draft verified documents from your own memory, with citation, freshness, and gap checks |
| 🌊 **Doc & Source Ingestion** | Crawl documentation sites and import sources (like mailboxes) into the same graph |
| 💎 **Multi-Tenancy** | Isolated graphs per organization, with role-based access. Enterprise-ready from day one |

## ⚡ Quickstart

### One-Liner Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperb1iss/sibyl/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs uv (if needed), installs the `sibyl` CLI, and starts Sibyl. Done.

### Manual Install

```bash
uv tool install sibyl-dev      # or: pipx install sibyl-dev
sibyl local start
```

### Lifecycle Commands

```bash
sibyl local start    # Start all services
sibyl local stop     # Stop services
sibyl local status   # Show running services
sibyl local logs     # Follow logs
sibyl local reset    # Nuke and start fresh
sibyl local setup    # Install Claude/Codex skills + hooks
```

### First Five Minutes

Everything below runs against your local Sibyl stack. MCP wiring is optional.

```bash
# Capture a learning the moment you find it
sibyl remember "Stale auth token bug" \
  "Redis TTL mismatch dropped the cached token early" --kind error_pattern

# Pull it back as working context for your next session
sibyl recall "auth token bug" --intent debug

# Or search semantically across the whole graph
sibyl search "stale auth token redis ttl"

# Package wake-up context for the next coding session
sibyl session bundle
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# One-line setup (installs proto, moon, toolchain, dependencies)
./setup-dev.sh

# Or manually:
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash
proto use                  # Installs node, pnpm, python, uv
proto install moon
uv sync && pnpm install

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Set SIBYL_JWT_SECRET (auto-generated in dev) and at least one LLM provider key.
# Embeddings use SIBYL_OPENAI_API_KEY or SIBYL_GEMINI_API_KEY.

# Install CLIs globally (editable, source changes reflect immediately)
moon run install-dev

# Launch the default local-dev stack (SurrealDB + API + web)
moon run dev

# Verify
curl http://localhost:3334/api/health
```

`moon run dev` is the single-machine flow. When `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL` is unset it starts
local SurrealDB, points the API at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc`, and stores data files in
`.moon/cache/surreal-dev`. Jobs and schedules run in-process by default
(`SIBYL_COORDINATION_BACKEND=local`). Set `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL` to connect to a hosted
SurrealDB endpoint, including Surreal Cloud, instead.

**Ports:**

| Service      | Port | URL                     |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------------------- |
| API + MCP    | 3334 | http://localhost:3334   |
| Web UI       | 3337 | http://localhost:3337   |
| SurrealDB    | 8000 | ws://localhost:8000/rpc |
| Redis/Valkey | 6381 | optional                |

## 🪄 The Memory Loop

Sibyl is built around a durable loop that both humans and agents follow:

```
recall ──▶ act ──▶ remember ──▶ reflect
   ▲                                │
   └────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Recall** working context before you start. `sibyl recall "<goal>"` returns a
   compact context pack: active work, decisions, plans, constraints, and recent
   lessons, scoped to your linked project.
2. **Act** with that context in hand.
3. **Remember** durable knowledge as you learn it. `sibyl remember` stores decisions,
   plans, ideas, claims, procedures, and gotchas so the next session does not
   rediscover them.
4. **Reflect** at clean breakpoints. `sibyl reflect` distills raw session notes into
   reviewable memory candidates and can persist them into the graph.

```bash
sibyl recall "ship the context graph" --intent build
sibyl remember "Use context packs" "Group memory before dispatching agents" --kind decision
sibyl reflect "We decided X. Next we build Y." --title "Planning checkpoint" --persist
```

Memory is graded, auditable, and scoped. Raw captures stay verbatim, reflection
candidates pass an automatic review before promotion, and a nightly dream-cycle keeps
the graph consolidated. See [`docs/guide/capturing-knowledge.md`](docs/guide/capturing-knowledge.md).

## The CLI

The CLI is the power-user interface. Clean output, built for scripting and durable
project workflows.

```bash
uv tool install sibyl-dev    # published package
moon run cli:install         # or install from source
```

### Command Families

```bash
# Memory loop
sibyl recall "<goal>"                 # Compile working context
sibyl remember "Title" "Body"         # Store durable memory
sibyl reflect "<notes>" --persist     # Distill notes into candidates
sibyl capture "<quick note>"          # Fast verbatim capture
sibyl search "authentication patterns"

# Knowledge & graph
sibyl add "Redis pooling" "Pool size must be >= concurrent requests"
sibyl explore related ent_xyz         # Find connected entities
sibyl entity show <id>                # Full content by ID

# Task workflow
sibyl task list --status todo,doing
sibyl task start <task_id>
sibyl task complete <task_id> --learnings "Key insight: check TTL first"

# Synthesis, sources, projects, orgs
sibyl synthesis draft "Onboarding guide"
sibyl crawl add "https://docs.example.com" --name "Example Docs"
sibyl project link proj_xxx
```

### Task Workflow

```
backlog ──▶ todo ──▶ doing ──▶ review ──▶ done ──▶ archived
                       │
                       ▼
                    blocked
```

### Output Formats

```bash
sibyl task list           # Table output (default)
sibyl task list --json    # JSON for scripts
sibyl task list --csv     # For spreadsheets
```

Full command reference: [`docs/cli/`](docs/cli/).

## MCP Integration

Connect Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client to Sibyl:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sibyl": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3334/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### The Tool API

Sibyl exposes eleven MCP tools, organized by what they do:

| Tool | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `search` | Unified semantic search across graph and crawled docs |
| `context` | Compile an agent context pack for a goal (intent + depth) |
| `explore` | Navigate the graph: list, related, traverse, dependencies |
| `add` | Create knowledge: episodes, patterns, tasks, projects |
| `remember` | Capture durable memory: decisions, plans, ideas, claims |
| `reflect` | Distill raw notes into reviewable memory candidates |
| `synthesis_plan` | Plan source-grounded synthesis from authorized memory |
| `synthesis_draft` | Draft, verify, and optionally remember an artifact |
| `synthesis_verify` | Verify citation, freshness, and gap coverage |
| `manage` | State changes: task lifecycle, crawling, analysis, admin |
| `logs` | Recent server logs (requires OWNER role) |

### Claude Code Skills & Hooks

Sibyl ships with [skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) and
[hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) for built-in Claude Code
integration.

```bash
moon run skills:install    # Install the /sibyl skill
moon run hooks:install     # Install context hooks
```

The `/sibyl` skill gives Claude Code full CLI access. Hooks inject context
automatically:

| Hook | Trigger | Action |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| **SessionStart** | Session begins | Prints a compact session bundle with active tasks and relevant memory |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | Every prompt | Searches the graph and injects relevant patterns as context |

See [`skills/`](skills/) and [`hooks/`](hooks/) for implementation details.

```

**Stack:**

- **Backend:** Python 3.13 / FastAPI / FastMCP / SurrealDB-native runtime
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 / React 19 / React Query / Tailwind 4
- **Storage:** SurrealDB unifies graph, content, and auth. PostgreSQL is retained only
  for migration and archive rehearsal.
- **AI:** A native LLM substrate routes Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini per surface, with
  pluggable embeddings.
- **Coordination:** In-process by default; Redis/Valkey is optional for multi-process
  or distributed deployments.
- **Build:** moonrepo + uv (Python) + pnpm (TypeScript)
- **Compatibility:** Graphiti is an optional extra (`sibyl-core[compatibility]`) used
  only for named migration and compatibility surfaces, not the default memory loop.

See [`docs/guide/why-surreal.md`](docs/guide/why-surreal.md) for the rationale and
[`docs/guide/storage-modes.md`](docs/guide/storage-modes.md) for the mode matrix.

## Authentication

### JWT Sessions (Web UI)

```bash
SIBYL_JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key        # Required (auto-generated in dev)
SIBYL_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60    # Optional (default: 60)
```

### API Keys (Programmatic Access)

```bash
sibyl auth api-key create --name "CI/CD" --scopes mcp,api:read
# Scopes: mcp, api:read, api:write
```

### OAuth (GitHub)

```bash
SIBYL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
SIBYL_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

MCP endpoints enforce Bearer auth when a JWT secret is set
(`SIBYL_MCP_AUTH_MODE=auto`). See [`docs/api/`](docs/api/) for the full auth reference.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
helm install sibyl ./charts/sibyl \
  --set backend.existingSecret=sibyl-secrets \
  --set backend.surreal.existingSecret=sibyl-surreal
```

See [`docs/deployment/`](docs/deployment/) for detailed guides:

- [Docker Compose](docs/deployment/docker-compose.md)
- [Kubernetes](docs/deployment/kubernetes.md)
- [Environment Variables](docs/deployment/environment.md)

## Knowledge Model

Sibyl models a wide range of entity types so memory stays structured, not just a pile
of notes:

- **Work:** `task`, `epic`, `project`, `milestone`
- **Knowledge:** `pattern`, `episode`, `procedure`, `rule`, `guide`, `error_pattern`
- **Memory:** `decision`, `plan`, `idea`, `claim`, `artifact`, `session`, `note`
- **Sources:** `source`, `document`, `domain`, `community`

The full registry and how types relate is documented in
[`docs/guide/entity-types.md`](docs/guide/entity-types.md).

## FAQ

### Who is Sibyl for?

**Solo developers** who want durable memory for projects and debugging. **Teams** who
want shared knowledge that compounds. **Anyone** building with AI who is tired of
repeating context every session.

### Do I need AI agents to use Sibyl?

No. The knowledge graph and task system are the core product: documentation, task
tracking, captured learnings, and semantic search over what your team already knows.
AI agents make the memory loop automatic, but they are not required.

### How does it compare to Mem0 / LangMem / similar?

Sibyl is **self-hosted and open source**. You own your data. It includes a full **task
workflow system**, not just memory. It has a **web UI** for humans, not just APIs for
machines. And it keeps knowledge, tasks, and docs connected in one graph instead of
scattering them across tools.

### What LLM APIs do I need?

- **Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini** (required): for language-model surfaces such as
  crawler extraction, synthesis, and reflection.
- **OpenAI or Gemini** (required): for embeddings and semantic search.

Providers and models are configurable globally or per surface through the native LLM
substrate. The web admin settings page can also save instance-wide model routing. A
typical solo developer uses around $5/month in API costs.

### Is it production-ready?

Sibyl is in active development (v0.9.x, heading toward 1.0). SurrealDB is the default
runtime for graph, content, and auth; legacy PostgreSQL paths are retained only for
migration and archive rehearsal. **We use Sibyl to build Sibyl.** Every feature, task,
and learning you see here was tracked inside the system itself.

## 🎯 Roadmap

**Where we're headed after v0.9.0, toward 1.0:**

- **Reflection OS:** automatic reflection review, nightly dream-cycle maintenance, and
  lifecycle findings that keep the graph consolidated without manual curation.
- **Memory trust:** audit receipts, scoped memory spaces, promotion review, and sharing
  controls so memory is legible instead of spooky.
- **Synthesis:** richer source-grounded artifacts with citation, freshness, and gap
  verification across more output types.
- **Source ingestion:** more import adapters beyond mailboxes, with resumable jobs.
- **Self-hosting:** one-command deploy on a tailnet with Ansible.

The graph gets smarter. The workflow gets sharper. See
[`docs/architecture/SIBYL_1_0_ROADMAP.md`](docs/architecture/SIBYL_1_0_ROADMAP.md).

## 💜 Philosophy

### Recall Before You Act

The graph knows things. Before you code, pull context:

```bash
sibyl recall "what you're building" --intent build
sibyl search "error you hit" --type episode
```

### Work In Task Context

Never do significant work outside a task. Tasks provide traceability, progress
tracking, and knowledge linking.

### Remember What You Learn

If it took time to figure out, save it:

```bash
sibyl remember "Descriptive title" "What, why, how, caveats" --kind decision
```

**Bad:** "Fixed the bug." **Good:** "JWT refresh fails when Redis TTL expires. Root
cause: token service does not handle WRONGTYPE. Fix: try/except with regeneration
fallback."

### Complete With Learnings

```bash
sibyl task complete <id> --learnings "Key insight: ..."
```

The graph should be smarter after every session.
