## 🔮 Why Sibyl

Sibyl is **cross-agent memory** for AI coding tools: one self-hostable knowledge graph shared across
Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, and the agents you build yourself. Tell one tool your context,
and every tool keeps it.

Most AI sessions start cold. Coding agents forget yesterday's decisions. Notes drift between
worktrees, tasks scatter across tools, and the context you earned the hard way evaporates the moment
a session ends.

The interaction surface is the shell. If your agent can run a command, it already speaks Sibyl. No
SDK to adopt, no MCP server you are locked into. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, Cline, and your
own scripts all recall context, capture learnings, and run task workflows the same way you do. MCP
is there for the clients that prefer it; the depth lives in the CLI.

A durable knowledge graph holds what matters: personal context, project work, shared spaces, source
documents, decisions, agent state. Each lives in its own scope and gets tied to the others when
context calls for it. A built-in memory loop (`recall → act → remember → reflect`) keeps hard-won
context close at hand for humans and AI alike. Source-grounded synthesis turns what you already know
into verified documents.

**Every session adds up instead of starting over.**

## ✦ What You Get

| Capability                       | What It Means                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔮 **Compounding Context**       | Every session adds to the graph instead of starting over. The longer you use it, the sharper it gets                   |
| 🪄 **The Memory Loop**           | `recall → act → remember → reflect` runs through the CLI, MCP, and hooks. Agents wake with context and leave it behind |
| 🎯 **Semantic Search**           | Find knowledge by meaning. "Authentication patterns" surfaces OAuth notes even when "OAuth" isn't in the text          |
| 🦋 **Task Workflow**             | Plan with epics and tasks, then track execution across sessions and teammates in one place                             |
| 🧪 **Source-Grounded Synthesis** | Draft verified documents from your own memory with citation, freshness, and gap checks                                 |
| 🌊 **Source Ingestion**          | Crawl documentation sites and import sources (mailboxes, archives) into scoped raw content and graph memory            |
| 💎 **Scoped Multi-Tenancy**      | Namespace-isolated graphs, org-scoped content/auth records, and policy gates for personal, project, and team scopes    |

## ⚡ Quickstart

### Shell Installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperb1iss/sibyl/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer puts `sibyl` on your PATH, starts the local API + web stack, and opens the setup UI
when it is ready. Use `--remote` for CLI-only installs and `--daemon` for the embedded daemon
without the web UI.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install hyperb1iss/tap/sibyl
sibyl up
```

### Remote CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperb1iss/sibyl/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --remote
sibyl init --remote https://sibyl.example.com
sibyl auth login
```

### Docker Self-Host

```bash
sibyl docker init       # Generate ~/.sibyl/docker/.env + compose
sibyl docker up         # Start API, web, and SurrealDB
sibyl docker logs       # Follow logs
sibyl docker down       # Stop services
sibyl docker upgrade    # Pull and recreate
```

### First Five Minutes

Everything below runs against your local Sibyl stack. MCP wiring is optional.

```bash
# Capture a learning the moment you find it
sibyl remember "Stale auth token bug" \
  "Redis TTL mismatch dropped the cached token early" --kind error_pattern

# Pull it back as working context for your next session
sibyl recall "auth token bug" --intent debug

# Or search semantically across the whole graph
sibyl search "stale auth token redis ttl"

# Package wake-up context for the next coding session
sibyl session bundle
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# One-line setup (installs proto, moon, toolchain, dependencies)
./setup-dev.sh            # macOS / Linux
pwsh -File .\setup-dev.ps1  # Windows (PowerShell 7+)

# Or manually:
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash
proto use                  # Installs node, pnpm, python, uv
proto install moon
uv sync && pnpm install

# Configure your shell
export SIBYL_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# SIBYL_JWT_SECRET is auto-generated in dev.
# Embeddings use SIBYL_OPENAI_API_KEY or SIBYL_GEMINI_API_KEY.

# Install CLIs globally (editable, source changes reflect immediately)
moon run install-dev

# Launch the default local-dev stack (SurrealDB + API + web)
moon run dev

# Verify
curl http://localhost:3334/api/health
```

`moon run dev` is the single-machine flow. When `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL` is unset it starts local
SurrealDB, points the API at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc`, and stores data files in
`.moon/cache/surreal-dev`. Jobs and schedules run in-process by default
(`SIBYL_COORDINATION_BACKEND=local`). Set `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL` to connect to a hosted SurrealDB
endpoint, including Surreal Cloud, instead.

**Ports:**

| Service      | Port | URL                     |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------------------- |
| API + MCP    | 3334 | http://localhost:3334   |
| Web UI       | 3337 | http://localhost:3337   |
| SurrealDB    | 8000 | ws://localhost:8000/rpc |
| Redis/Valkey | 6381 | optional                |

## 🪄 The Memory Loop

Sibyl is built around a durable loop that both humans and agents follow:

```
recall ──▶ act ──▶ remember ──▶ reflect
   ▲                                │
   └────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Recall** working context before you start. `sibyl recall "<goal>"` returns a compact context
   pack: active work, decisions, plans, constraints, and recent lessons, scoped to your linked
   project.
2. **Act** with that context in hand.
3. **Remember** durable knowledge as you learn it. `sibyl remember` stores decisions, plans, ideas,
   claims, procedures, and gotchas so the next session does not rediscover them.
4. **Reflect** at clean breakpoints. `sibyl reflect` distills raw session notes into reviewable
   memory candidates and can persist them into the graph.

```bash
sibyl recall "ship the context graph" --intent build
sibyl remember "Use context packs" "Group memory before dispatching agents" --kind decision
sibyl reflect "We decided X. Next we build Y." --title "Planning checkpoint" --persist
```

Memory is graded, auditable, and scoped. Raw captures stay verbatim, reflection candidates pass an
automatic review before promotion, and a nightly dream-cycle keeps the graph consolidated. See
[`docs/guide/capturing-knowledge.md`](docs/guide/capturing-knowledge.md).

## The CLI

The CLI is the power-user interface. Clean output, built for scripting and durable project
workflows.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperb1iss/sibyl/main/install.sh | sh
moon run cli:install         # or install from source
```

### Command Families

```bash
# Memory loop
sibyl recall "<goal>"                 # Compile working context
sibyl remember "Title" "Body"         # Store durable memory
sibyl reflect "<notes>" --persist     # Distill notes into candidates
sibyl capture "<quick note>"          # Fast verbatim capture
sibyl search "authentication patterns"

# Knowledge & graph
sibyl add "Redis pooling" "Pool size must be >= concurrent requests"
sibyl explore related ent_xyz         # Find connected entities
sibyl show <id>                       # Full content by ID

# Task workflow

# Synthesis, sources, projects, orgs
sibyl synthesis draft "Onboarding guide"
sibyl crawl add "https://docs.example.com" --name "Example Docs"
sibyl project link proj_xxx
```

### Task Workflow

```
backlog ──▶ todo ──▶ doing ──▶ review ──▶ done ──▶ archived
                       │
                       ▼
                    blocked
```

### Output Formats

```bash
sibyl task list           # Table output (default)
sibyl task list --json    # JSON for scripts
sibyl task list --csv     # For spreadsheets
```

Full command reference: [`docs/cli/`](docs/cli/).

## 🦋 Web UI

A full admin interface at `http://localhost:3337`:

- **Dashboard:** Stats overview, recent activity, quick actions
- **Tasks:** Kanban-style workflow with inline editing
- **Graph:** Interactive force-directed visualization of knowledge connections
- **Search:** Semantic search with filters
- **Memory:** The memory workspace, raw captures, source imports, and synthesis

**Built with:** Next.js 16, React 19, React Query, Tailwind CSS 4, and the SilkCircuit design
system.

## MCP Integration

Connect Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client to Sibyl:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sibyl": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3334/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### The Tool API

Sibyl exposes eleven MCP tools, organized by what they do:

| Tool               | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search`           | Unified semantic search across graph and crawled docs     |
| `context`          | Compile an agent context pack for a goal (intent + depth) |
| `explore`          | Navigate the graph: list, related, traverse, dependencies |
| `add`              | Create knowledge: episodes, patterns, tasks, projects     |
| `remember`         | Capture durable memory: decisions, plans, ideas, claims   |
| `reflect`          | Distill raw notes into reviewable memory candidates       |
| `synthesis_plan`   | Plan source-grounded synthesis from authorized memory     |
| `synthesis_draft`  | Draft, verify, and optionally remember an artifact        |
| `synthesis_verify` | Verify citation, freshness, and gap coverage              |
| `manage`           | State changes: task lifecycle, crawling, analysis, admin  |
| `logs`             | Recent server logs (requires OWNER role)                  |

### Claude Code Skills & Hooks

Sibyl ships with [skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) and
[hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) for built-in Claude Code integration.

```bash
sibyl skill install        # Install the tiny /sibyl loader skill
sibyl skill get core       # Print version-matched guidance from the CLI bundle
moon run hooks:install     # Optional Claude Code context hooks for repo dev
```

The installed `/sibyl` skill is intentionally tiny. It points agents back to the installed CLI,
which serves the full markdown skill packs for the exact Sibyl version on the machine. A single hook
nudges the agent at session boundaries; everything else is the agent's job:

| Hook             | Trigger        | Action                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SessionStart** | Session begins | Prints a compact session bundle with active tasks and relevant memory |

The agent is responsible for invoking the `sibyl` skill and calling `sibyl recall` /
`sibyl context pack` for working memory. We previously shipped a per-prompt context-injection hook
(`UserPromptSubmit`) but removed it: it substituted for skill invocation instead of prompting it,
and agents stopped reaching for the CLI.

See [`skills/`](skills/) and [`hooks/`](hooks/) for implementation details.

**Stack:**

- **Backend:** Python 3.13 / FastAPI / FastMCP / SurrealDB-native runtime
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 / React 19 / React Query / Tailwind 4
- **Storage:** SurrealDB unifies graph, content, and auth. PostgreSQL is retained only for migration
  and archive rehearsal.
- **AI routing:** Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini swap per surface; embeddings are pluggable.
- **Coordination:** In-process by default; Redis/Valkey is optional for multi-process or distributed
  deployments.
- **Build:** moonrepo + uv (Python) + pnpm (TypeScript)
- **Compatibility:** Legacy Graphiti-shaped records are handled by Sibyl-owned Surreal projection
  and archive code. No supported install pulls Graphiti.

See [`docs/guide/why-surreal.md`](docs/guide/why-surreal.md) for the rationale and
[`docs/guide/storage-modes.md`](docs/guide/storage-modes.md) for the mode matrix.

## 🧪 Benchmarks

Sibyl reaches the LongMemEval-S retrieval ceiling on the live API path with no LLM extraction and no
LLM reranking.

| Metric           | Value                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `hit@5`          | **100.00%** (500/500)                         |
| `recall@5`       | **96.96%** (strict multi-answer)              |
| `recall@10`      | **98.90%**                                    |
| `ndcg@5`         | 94.63%                                        |
| Questions        | 500/500                                       |
| LLM extraction   | disabled                                      |
| LLM reranking    | none                                          |
| Embeddings       | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, 1024 dims    |
| Tenant isolation | graph namespace + scoped content per question |

The result is measured against the production `/api/search` surface in an ephemeral CI stack, not an
offline notebook replay. Each question gets an isolated graph namespace with scoped content rows,
and the full artifact and diagnostics are published.

`hit@5 = 100%` and strict `recall@5 = 96.96%` measure different things and we report both: hit asks
"did _any_ correct session land in the top 5", strict recall asks "did _every_ correct session land
for multi-answer questions". Many LongMemEval-S questions have multiple correct answer sessions,
which is why these numbers diverge.

A few comparisons that are _not_ apples-to-apples are usually shown side by side in this space —
retrieval recall vs LLM-judged QA accuracy is the most common conflation. See
[AI Memory Landscape](docs/testing/ai-memory-landscape.md) for the honest field positioning.

## Authentication

### JWT Sessions (Web UI)

```bash
SIBYL_JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key        # Required in production; dev auto-generates
SIBYL_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60    # Optional (default: 60)
```

### API Keys (Programmatic Access)

```bash
sibyl auth api-key create --name "CI/CD" --scopes mcp,api:read
# Scopes: mcp, api:read, api:write
```

### OAuth (GitHub)

```bash
SIBYL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
SIBYL_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

MCP endpoints enforce Bearer auth when a JWT secret is set (`SIBYL_MCP_AUTH_MODE=auto`). See
[`docs/api/`](docs/api/) for the full auth reference.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

```bash
sibyl docker init
sibyl docker up
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
helm install sibyl ./charts/sibyl \
  --set backend.existingSecret=sibyl-secrets \
  --set backend.surreal.existingSecret=sibyl-surreal \
  --set ingress.enabled=true
```

See [`docs/deployment/`](docs/deployment/) for detailed guides:

- [Docker Compose](docs/deployment/docker-compose.md)
- [Kubernetes](docs/deployment/kubernetes.md)
- [Environment Variables](docs/deployment/environment.md)

## Knowledge Model

Sibyl models a wide range of entity types so memory stays structured, not just a pile of notes:

- **Work:** `task`, `epic`, `project`, `milestone`
- **Knowledge:** `pattern`, `episode`, `procedure`, `rule`, `guide`, `error_pattern`
- **Memory:** `decision`, `plan`, `idea`, `claim`, `artifact`, `session`, `note`
- **Sources:** `source`, `document`, `domain`, `community`

The full registry and how types relate is documented in
[`docs/guide/entity-types.md`](docs/guide/entity-types.md).

## FAQ

### Who is Sibyl for?

**Solo developers** who want durable memory for projects and debugging. **Teams** who want shared
knowledge that compounds. **Anyone** building with AI who is tired of repeating context every
session.

### Do I need AI agents to use Sibyl?

No. The knowledge graph and task system are the core product: documentation, task tracking, captured
learnings, and semantic search over what your team already knows. AI agents make the memory loop
automatic, but they are not required.

### How does it compare to Mem0 / LangMem / similar?

Sibyl is **self-hosted and open source**. You own your data. It includes a full **task workflow
system**, not just memory. It has a **web UI** for humans, not just APIs for machines. And it keeps
knowledge, tasks, and docs connected in one graph instead of scattering them across tools.

On retrieval quality: Sibyl reaches the LongMemEval-S retrieval ceiling (500/500 `hit@5`, 96.96%
strict `recall@5`, 98.90% `recall@10`) on the live API path with no LLM extraction or LLM reranking.
Many published "LongMemEval" numbers are end-to-end QA accuracy with an LLM judge, which is a
different metric than retrieval recall — see
[`docs/testing/ai-memory-landscape.md`](docs/testing/ai-memory-landscape.md) for honest side-by-side
positioning.

### What LLM APIs do I need?

- **Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini** (required): for language-model surfaces such as crawler
  extraction, synthesis, and reflection.
- **OpenAI or Gemini** (required): for embeddings and semantic search.

Providers and models are configurable globally or per surface, and the web admin settings page can
save instance-wide model routing. A typical solo developer uses around $5/month in API costs.

### Is it production-ready?

Sibyl is in active development (v0.10.x, heading toward 1.0). SurrealDB is the default runtime for
graph, content, and auth; legacy PostgreSQL paths are retained only for migration and archive
rehearsal. **We use Sibyl to build Sibyl.** Every feature, task, and learning you see here was
tracked inside the system itself.

## 🎯 Roadmap

**Where we're headed after v0.10.0, toward 1.0:**

- **Corpus Runtime:** real private source corpora can be imported, searched, inspected, corrected,
  and synthesized without leaking scope.
- **Memory Workspace OS:** automatic memory decisions become visible, explainable, correctable, and
  undoable from one product surface.
- **Surreal-only closure:** remaining legacy assumptions leave the supported runtime once native
  behavior has receipts.
- **1.0 evidence freeze:** release claims cite gates, artifacts, and install rehearsals.

The graph gets smarter. The workflow gets sharper. See
[`docs/architecture/SIBYL_1_0_ROADMAP.md`](docs/architecture/SIBYL_1_0_ROADMAP.md).

## 💜 Philosophy

### Recall Before You Act

The graph knows things. Before you code, pull context:

```bash
sibyl recall "what you're building" --intent build
sibyl search "error you hit" --type episode
```

### Work In Task Context

Never do significant work outside a task. Tasks provide traceability, progress tracking, and
knowledge linking.

### Remember What You Learn

If it took time to figure out, save it:

```bash
sibyl remember "Descriptive title" "What, why, how, caveats" --kind decision
```

**Bad:** "Fixed the bug." **Good:** "JWT refresh fails when Redis TTL expires. Root cause: token
service does not handle WRONGTYPE. Fix: try/except with regeneration fallback."

### Complete With Learnings

```bash
sibyl task complete <id> --learnings "Key insight: ..."
```

The graph should be smarter after every session.
