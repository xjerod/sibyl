# Benchmark Methodology

Sibyl now treats retrieval evaluation as a small ladder instead of one overloaded command. That
keeps local smoke checks, runtime artifacts, and offline baselines from drifting into the same
story.

## Recommended Order

1. `moon run bench-live -- --label legacy --metadata store=legacy`
2. `moon run bench-live-smoke`
3. `moon run bench-retrieval`
4. `uv run python benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.py /path/to/longmemeval.json --mode hybrid`

## What Each Command Measures

### `moon run bench-live`

This is the canonical runtime benchmark.

- Talks to the live Sibyl API
- Uses the same CLI auth headers a real local user would send
- Exercises real `/api/search` or RAG HTTP surfaces
- Uses the shared evaluation runner from `sibyl_core.evals`
- Writes timestamped JSON reports to `benchmarks/results/` by default
- Accepts `--label` and repeated `--metadata key=value` flags for saved artifacts

Use this when you want artifact-producing evidence about the current running stack.

### `moon run bench-live-smoke`

This is the fast live health guard.

- Talks to the live Sibyl API
- Stays read-only
- Verifies latency budgets, response shape, and basic filtered search behavior
- Runs as pytest so it fits normal local and CI-style workflows

Use this when you want a quick “is the live stack behaving sensibly?” signal.

### `moon run bench-retrieval`

This is the synthetic component benchmark.

- Runs retrieval helpers in-process
- Measures temporal boosting, fusion, and small benchmark fixtures
- Good for regression checks while tuning retrieval internals
- Not a measurement of the deployed HTTP runtime path

Use this for local retrieval engineering, not for product positioning.

### `benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.py`

This is the offline baseline.

- Uses an ephemeral Chroma-backed index
- Replays LongMemEval-style data for apples-to-apples offline comparison
- Useful for internal baselines and competitor-style framing
- Explicitly does not touch the live graph or API runtime

Use this for offline comparison work, and label it clearly as such.

## Threshold Gates

Saved runtime artifacts should go through `moon run bench-gate -- <report.json>` before they count
as acceptance evidence.

The default `acceptance` profile enforces:

- `success@5 >= 0.40`
- `ndcg@10 >= 0.30`
- `mrr >= 0.25`
- `latency_ms <= 3000`

The lighter `smoke` profile keeps just the fast guardrails:

- `success@5 >= 0.20`
- `latency_ms <= 3000`

Use `--require-metadata store=surreal` or other metadata filters when you need to prove which stack
produced the artifact. Use `--min-metric` and `--max-metric` to tighten a gate for a specific run
without forking the script.

## Reporting Rules

- Lead with `bench-live` when describing Sibyl’s current runtime behavior.
- Treat `bench-live-smoke` as a guardrail, not as headline benchmark evidence.
- Treat offline baselines as directional. Do not present them as production latency or runtime
  quality claims.
- Keep the artifact JSON from `bench-live` whenever you cite a number in docs or PRs.
- If the live stack or auth context is unavailable, say so explicitly instead of substituting an
  offline result.

## Suggested PR Notes

- Runtime evidence: artifact path from `benchmarks/results/`
- Smoke evidence: `moon run bench-live-smoke`
- Offline evidence, if relevant: `moon run bench-retrieval` or `longmemeval_bench.py`

## Store Comparison Flow

When you need to compare legacy and Surreal on the same graph data:

1. Export a manifest archive from the source store with
   `sibyld migrate export --org-id <org> --output /tmp/migration.tar.gz`
2. Rehearse the import path on the target store with
   `moon run migrate-rehearse -- /tmp/migration.tar.gz --yes --restore-postgres`
3. Run `moon run bench-live -- --label <store> --metadata store=<store>`
4. Compare the saved artifacts with
   `uv run python benchmarks/compare_eval_reports.py <legacy.json> <surreal.json>`

The rehearsal command handles archive validation, optional PostgreSQL restore, graph import, runtime
verification, and the deterministic baseline replay in one pass. Use `--restore-postgres` when you
want a full FalkorDB/PostgreSQL migration rehearsal instead of a graph-only replay. That keeps the
public story honest and makes it much easier to compare runs over time.

When you are ready for a real maintenance-window swap, use
`sibyld migrate cutover /tmp/migration.tar.gz --yes --write-freeze-confirmed` on the Surreal
runtime. That command keeps writes frozen through import, verification, baseline replay, and any
optional live bench checks. Reopening writes is a separate explicit step with
`--reopen-writes --acknowledge-no-instant-rollback`, because instant zero-loss rollback is not
promised after Surreal starts accepting new writes.

Run `moon run chaos-archive -- /tmp/migration.tar.gz` when you want a quick corruption drill for the
archive format itself. The current probe mutates checksums, graph counts, and organization IDs to
make sure the validator rejects obviously bad cutover inputs before a restore window starts.
