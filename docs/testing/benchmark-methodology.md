# Benchmark Methodology

Sibyl now treats retrieval evaluation as a small ladder instead of one overloaded command. That
keeps local smoke checks, runtime artifacts, and offline baselines from drifting into the same
story.

## Recommended Order

1. `moon run bench-live -- --label legacy --metadata store=legacy`
2. `moon run bench-live-smoke`
3. `moon run bench-retrieval`
4. `uv run python benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.py /path/to/longmemeval.json --mode hybrid`

## What Each Command Measures

### `moon run bench-live`

This is the canonical runtime benchmark.

- Talks to the live Sibyl API
- Uses the same CLI auth headers a real local user would send
- Exercises real `/api/search` or RAG HTTP surfaces
- Uses the shared evaluation runner from `sibyl_core.evals`
- Writes timestamped JSON reports to `benchmarks/results/` by default
- Accepts `--label` and repeated `--metadata key=value` flags for saved artifacts

Use this when you want artifact-producing evidence about the current running stack.

### `moon run bench-live-smoke`

This is the fast live health guard.

- Talks to the live Sibyl API
- Stays read-only
- Verifies latency budgets, response shape, and basic filtered search behavior
- Runs as pytest so it fits normal local and CI-style workflows

Use this when you want a quick “is the live stack behaving sensibly?” signal.

### `moon run bench-retrieval`

This is the synthetic component benchmark.

- Runs retrieval helpers in-process
- Measures temporal boosting, fusion, and small benchmark fixtures
- Good for regression checks while tuning retrieval internals
- Not a measurement of the deployed HTTP runtime path

Use this for local retrieval engineering, not for product positioning.

### `benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.py`

This is the offline baseline.

- Uses an ephemeral Chroma-backed index
- Replays LongMemEval-style data for apples-to-apples offline comparison
- Useful for internal baselines and competitor-style framing
- Explicitly does not touch the live graph or API runtime

Use this for offline comparison work, and label it clearly as such.

## Reporting Rules

- Lead with `bench-live` when describing Sibyl’s current runtime behavior.
- Treat `bench-live-smoke` as a guardrail, not as headline benchmark evidence.
- Treat offline baselines as directional. Do not present them as production latency or runtime
  quality claims.
- Keep the artifact JSON from `bench-live` whenever you cite a number in docs or PRs.
- If the live stack or auth context is unavailable, say so explicitly instead of substituting an
  offline result.

## Suggested PR Notes

- Runtime evidence: artifact path from `benchmarks/results/`
- Smoke evidence: `moon run bench-live-smoke`
- Offline evidence, if relevant: `moon run bench-retrieval` or `longmemeval_bench.py`

## Store Comparison Flow

When you need to compare legacy and Surreal on the same graph data:

1. Export the source org graph with `sibyld export graph --org-id <org> --output /tmp/graph.json`
2. Boot the target store and import it with `sibyld db restore /tmp/graph.json --org-id <org> --yes`
3. Run `moon run bench-live -- --label <store> --metadata store=<store>`
4. Compare the saved artifacts with `uv run python benchmarks/compare_eval_reports.py <legacy.json> <surreal.json>`

That split keeps the public story honest and makes it much easier to compare runs over time.
