# Migrating from FalkorDB

Sibyl ships CLI tooling to move an organization (or a whole install) from the legacy FalkorDB +
PostgreSQL stack to SurrealDB. The migration is an explicit, reversible operation — nothing happens
automatically when you upgrade.

SurrealDB is the default runtime now. Legacy and mixed modes remain as compatibility paths for
existing installs during the migration window, but new deployments should not start on FalkorDB or
PostgreSQL auth.

## Before you start

- **Both stacks online.** Keep FalkorDB + PostgreSQL running during migration. You'll only stop them
  after verification passes.
- **SurrealDB reachable.** Have a Surreal instance running. For local dev, `moon run dev` starts
  local SurrealDB automatically. For production, set `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL=ws://...`.
- **Take a fresh backup** of the source org first. `sibyld db backup --org-id <uuid>` dumps the
  current graph; archive archives are read-only so keeping a pre-migration snapshot is cheap
  insurance.
- **Rehearse.** Run the migration against a staging SurrealDB first to confirm the archive loads and
  counts match.

## The three-step flow

### 1. Export from legacy

```bash
SIBYL_STORE=legacy sibyld migrate export \
  --org-id <org-uuid> \
  --output /tmp/sibyl-migration.tar.gz
```

This writes a versioned archive containing:

- `graph.json` — Entities, relationships, and episodes from FalkorDB
- `postgres.sql` — Optional relational dump (users, API keys, crawled docs)
- `auth.json` / `content.json` — Structured auth and content payloads
- `manifest.json` — Counts and checksums for verification

### 2. Import to SurrealDB

```bash
SIBYL_STORE=surreal \
SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal \
SIBYL_SURREAL_URL=ws://localhost:8000/rpc \
sibyld migrate import /tmp/sibyl-migration.tar.gz
```

The structured `auth.json` and `content.json` payloads restore directly into SurrealDB.
`--restore-database-dump` is only needed if the target is in mixed mode or you want to keep a
relational copy during transition.

### 3. Verify

```bash
SIBYL_STORE=surreal sibyld migrate verify /tmp/sibyl-migration.tar.gz
```

Verification samples entities and episodes, compares counts against the archive manifest, and
confirms relationship integrity. Non-zero exit on mismatch.

## Rehearsal mode

For production migrations, rehearse against a disposable SurrealDB first:

```bash
moon run migrate-rehearse -- /tmp/sibyl-migration.tar.gz --yes
```

This runs the full export → import → verify cycle without touching your production target. It's the
safest pre-cutover check — the rehearsal must pass green before the real run.

The rehearsal runs the deterministic auth-flow replay by default. It signs up users, rotates tokens,
exercises API keys, invitations, org switching, device auth, logout revocation, session listing, and
password reset consumption through the configured email outbox.

## Auth flow gates

Run the live auth replay directly when you want a focused check:

```bash
moon run auth-flow-replay -- --base-url http://localhost:3334
```

For final auth cutover confidence, compare a Postgres-backed API and a Surreal-backed API:

```bash
moon run auth-flow-compare -- \
  --postgres-base-url http://localhost:3334 \
  --surreal-base-url http://localhost:3335
```

The comparison ignores generated IDs, raw tokens, and timestamps. It compares the replayed step
sequence and normalized JWT claim shape, including `sub`, `org`, `typ`, `sid`, and refresh-token
`jti` presence.

## Local shortcut

For single-org local dev moves:

```bash
moon run dev -- --migrate-legacy
```

`moon run dev` detects local legacy data before it starts a fresh Surreal runtime. If there is
exactly one legacy organization, `--migrate-legacy` selects it automatically, exports it, imports it
into the local Surreal instance, verifies the archive, and writes a migrated marker so future starts
go straight to Surreal.

If there are multiple organizations, the command lists their IDs and asks you to rerun with
`--org-id <org-uuid>`. You can also run the same wrapper directly:

```bash
moon run migrate-local-surreal -- --org-id <org-uuid>
```

## Cutover

1. Stop writes to the legacy API (drain requests, flip the ingress).
2. Run export → import → verify against the current data.
3. Point clients at the new Surreal-backed API (`SIBYL_STORE=surreal`, new `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL`).
4. Freeze the legacy auth/RBAC tables so stale code paths cannot accept new writes:

```bash
moon run auth-readonly -- --mode freeze --apply --yes
```

5. Keep legacy containers up for a few days as a rollback option. They hold read-only history until
   you're confident.
6. Decommission FalkorDB + PostgreSQL once traffic has run cleanly on Surreal and your rollback
   window has closed.

## Rollback

If post-cutover verification reveals a problem:

1. Point clients back at the legacy API (`SIBYL_STORE=legacy`).
2. Remove the auth/RBAC read-only guard before resuming legacy writes:

```bash
moon run auth-readonly -- --mode unfreeze --apply --yes
```

3. The legacy stack is otherwise unchanged — the export is non-destructive.
4. File an issue with the archive manifest and the failing verification output.

## FAQ

**Do I need to migrate?** Not immediately, but yes, you should plan it during the compatibility
window. Legacy mode remains available for existing installs during the transition; SurrealDB is the
default runtime and the path forward.

**Can I migrate org-by-org?** Yes. Each export is scoped to a single `--org-id`. Run them in
whatever order suits your tenant sizing.

**What about embedding models?** Embeddings are migrated verbatim. If you switch embedding models
(`SIBYL_EMBEDDING_MODEL`), plan a re-indexing pass separately — the migration tool doesn't re-embed
content.

**Can I run both stacks in parallel?** Yes. Use different `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and port offsets
(see [environment.md](../deployment/environment.md#running-multiple-instances)).
