# Migrating from FalkorDB

Sibyl ships CLI tooling to move an organization (or a whole install) from the legacy FalkorDB +
PostgreSQL stack to SurrealDB. The migration is an explicit, reversible operation — nothing happens
automatically when you upgrade.

## Before you start

- **Both stacks online.** Keep FalkorDB + PostgreSQL running during migration. You'll only stop them
  after verification passes.
- **SurrealDB reachable.** Have a Surreal instance running. For local dev, `moon run dev` starts
  embedded SurrealDB automatically. For production, set `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL=ws://...`.
- **Take a fresh backup** of the source org first. `sibyld db backup --org-id <uuid>` dumps the
  current graph; archive archives are read-only so keeping a pre-migration snapshot is cheap
  insurance.
- **Rehearse.** Run the migration against a staging SurrealDB first to confirm the archive loads and
  counts match.

## The three-step flow

### 1. Export from legacy

```bash
SIBYL_STORE=legacy sibyld migrate export \
  --org-id <org-uuid> \
  --output /tmp/sibyl-migration.tar.gz
```

This writes a versioned archive containing:

- `graph.json` — Entities, relationships, and episodes from FalkorDB
- `postgres.sql` — Optional relational dump (users, API keys, crawled docs)
- `auth.json` / `content.json` — Structured auth and content payloads
- `manifest.json` — Counts and checksums for verification

### 2. Import to SurrealDB

```bash
SIBYL_STORE=surreal \
SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal \
SIBYL_SURREAL_URL=ws://localhost:8000/rpc \
sibyld migrate import /tmp/sibyl-migration.tar.gz \
  --restore-database-dump   # Replay relational dump too
```

Restore order is: PostgreSQL dump → graph → auth → content. `--restore-database-dump` is only
needed if the target is in mixed mode or you want to keep a relational copy during transition.

### 3. Verify

```bash
SIBYL_STORE=surreal sibyld migrate verify /tmp/sibyl-migration.tar.gz
```

Verification samples entities and episodes, compares counts against the archive manifest, and
confirms relationship integrity. Non-zero exit on mismatch.

## Rehearsal mode

For production migrations, rehearse against a disposable SurrealDB first:

```bash
moon run migrate-rehearse
```

This runs the full export → import → verify cycle without touching your production target. It's the
safest pre-cutover check — the rehearsal must pass green before the real run.

## Local shortcut

For single-org local dev moves:

```bash
moon run migrate-local-surreal -- --org-id <org-uuid>
```

This wraps export → import → verify in one command against the local Surreal instance.

## Cutover

1. Stop writes to the legacy API (drain requests, flip the ingress).
2. Run export → import → verify against the current data.
3. Point clients at the new Surreal-backed API (`SIBYL_STORE=surreal`, new `SIBYL_SURREAL_URL`).
4. Keep legacy containers up for a few days as a rollback option. They hold read-only history until
   you're confident.
5. Decommission FalkorDB + PostgreSQL once traffic has run cleanly on Surreal.

## Rollback

If post-cutover verification reveals a problem:

1. Point clients back at the legacy API (`SIBYL_STORE=legacy`).
2. The legacy stack is unchanged — the export is non-destructive.
3. File an issue with the archive manifest and the failing verification output.

## FAQ

**Do I need to migrate?** No. Legacy mode is fully supported. Migrate when it's convenient for you.

**Can I migrate org-by-org?** Yes. Each export is scoped to a single `--org-id`. Run them in
whatever order suits your tenant sizing.

**What about embedding models?** Embeddings are migrated verbatim. If you switch embedding models
(`SIBYL_EMBEDDING_MODEL`), plan a re-indexing pass separately — the migration tool doesn't re-embed
content.

**Can I run both stacks in parallel?** Yes. Use different `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and port offsets
(see [environment.md](../deployment/environment.md#running-multiple-instances)).
