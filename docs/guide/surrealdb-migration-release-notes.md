# SurrealDB Migration Release Notes

Sibyl now starts the SurrealDB runtime by default. New installs should use SurrealDB for graph,
content, and auth. Do not start new deployments on FalkorDB or PostgreSQL auth.

Legacy FalkorDB + PostgreSQL support remains available for existing installs during the migration
window. It is a compatibility bridge, not the long-term runtime. Plan your migration now; the
PostgreSQL auth store is scheduled for removal after one compatibility release once the live
migration gates are green.

## What changed

- `moon run dev` starts the SurrealDB runtime.
- `SIBYL_STORE=surreal` and `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal` are the default settings.
- `moon run dev-legacy` is the explicit FalkorDB + PostgreSQL fallback.
- `moon run dev` detects local legacy data before creating a fresh Surreal dev runtime.
- `moon run dev -- --migrate-legacy` migrates the common single-org local setup automatically.

## Existing local installs

If you have an old local FalkorDB + PostgreSQL install, run:

```bash
moon run dev -- --migrate-legacy
```

For the common single-org setup, Sibyl selects the only organization automatically. You do not need
to know the org ID.

If multiple organizations exist, Sibyl prints the available org IDs and asks you to rerun with:

```bash
moon run migrate-local-surreal -- --org-id <org-uuid>
```

To keep using the old stack for debugging or migration work:

```bash
moon run dev-legacy
```

## Existing production installs

Use the full migration playbook, not the local shortcut:

1. Back up the legacy install.
2. Export the legacy archive.
3. Rehearse the archive against a disposable SurrealDB target.
4. Import into SurrealDB.
5. Run archive verification.
6. Run the auth-flow replay against the Surreal-backed API.
7. Compare live PostgreSQL-auth and Surreal-auth stacks before cutover.
8. Freeze legacy auth/RBAC writes during the rollback window.

Start with [Migrating from FalkorDB](./migrating-from-falkor.md).

`sibyld migrate auth-flow-compare` refuses to compare one API to itself by default. Start one
legacy-auth API and one Surreal-auth API, then pass distinct `--postgres-base-url` and
`--surreal-base-url` values. Use `--allow-same-base-url` only when debugging the harness itself.

## Compatibility window

These paths stay available for one release cycle:

- `moon run dev-legacy`
- `SIBYL_STORE=legacy`
- `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=postgres`
- PostgreSQL auth/RBAC archive export
- FalkorDB graph archive export

After that compatibility window, Sibyl will remove the old auth/RBAC runtime first. Remaining
non-auth PostgreSQL consumers will be removed in the Phase 3 storage cleanup.

## Rollback posture

The migration is explicit and archive-backed. Upgrading does not destructively rewrite your legacy
data. If a cutover fails before Surreal accepts new writes, point traffic back to the legacy API and
unfreeze auth/RBAC writes.

Once Surreal accepts new production writes, treating PostgreSQL as an instant read-write rollback is
unsafe. Restore from the pre-cutover archive and replay any Surreal-only writes deliberately.
