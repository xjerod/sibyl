# Sibyl v0.8 Pure Surreal Closure and Memory Trust Plan

- Status: active execution plan
- Target release: v0.8
- Planning source: `plan_e464fd1e7b11`
- Plan-authoring task: `c64a358e-aef4-4b32-8735-28f03047a13e`
- Tracking epics:
  - Pure Surreal Closure: `epic_416f955f7f39`
  - Memory Trust Foundation: `epic_539eea7afeb3`
- Related docs:
  - `docs/architecture/SIBYL_NORTHSTAR.md`
  - `docs/architecture/SURREALDB_NATIVE_MEMORY_CORE_SPEC.md`
  - `docs/architecture/SURREALDB_V07_GRAPHITI_EXIT_AND_PURE_SURREAL_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/architecture/SURREALDB_GRAPHITI_EXIT_INVENTORY.md`
  - `docs/architecture/SURREALDB_PHASE3_BURNDOWN.md`
  - `docs/architecture/PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`

v0.7 made the SurrealDB-native memory loop real. The default `remember`, `recall`, `context`,
`wake`, `reflect`, task workflow, jobs, CLI, MCP, and prompt-hook surfaces can run without Graphiti
or legacy services on the hot path. v0.8 should make that state boring and durable.

The next large chunk has two tracks:

1. Pure Surreal closure: remove, quarantine, or explicitly name the remaining compatibility
   scaffolding so a normal install and normal runtime are Surreal-only.
2. Memory trust foundation: install the identity, policy, audit, and inspection substrate needed
   before Sibyl expands into memory spaces, sharing, team memory, and graph-guided synthesis.

These tracks are connected. Pure Surreal closure reduces operational ambiguity. Memory trust makes
the second brain safe enough to use for personal, delegated, project, team, and organization memory
without leaking the wrong context.

## 1. Current State

Verified on 2026-05-13 during the A0 baseline lock:

- Local baseline commit: `1de0b408`.
- Last pushed `origin/main` receipt commit: `d2d3d926`.
- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test` passes; generated inventory is
  current and covers 21 Graphiti import files; inventory tests report 14 passed.
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke` passes with 2 tests.
- `moon run :check` passes with 33 tasks completed, including 5 executed tasks and 28 cache hits.
  Receipts include core 1327 passed and 15 skipped, API 1639 passed and 1 skipped, CLI 156 passed,
  and web 88 passed.
- Main CI is green on `origin/main` run ID `25801942331`. Docs deploy is green on run ID
  `25801942466`. Scheduled nightly regression is green on run ID `25791871706`.
- Local `main` is ahead of `origin/main`; the CI receipts cover the latest pushed main commit, and
  the local receipts cover this A0 checkpoint.
- Default `sibyl-core` runtime dependencies do not include `graphiti-core`; Graphiti is isolated to
  the `compatibility` optional extra and `sibyl-core` dev dependency group.
- Generated inventory still lists 21 Graphiti import files. They are classified as compatibility,
  admin, migration, or test scaffolding, not default-loop requirements.
- Default compose, CI, and docs are already SurrealDB-first, with Redis/Valkey as explicit
  coordination opt-in.
- Phase 3 burndown still carries archive, rollback, stale docs, and compatibility-policy residue.
- The permission audit identifies project RBAC, MCP policy context, setup endpoint gating, and audit
  consistency as the next security-sensitive control-plane work.

## 2. Release Definition

v0.8 is ready when all of these are true:

- A default install, default local dev run, default CI run, and default chart render do not need
  Graphiti, FalkorDB, PostgreSQL, or Redis/Valkey as data services.
- Any retained Graphiti code lives in one named compatibility island and cannot be imported by
  default application boot, CLI, MCP tools, jobs, prompt hooks, context packs, task workflow, or
  native retrieval.
- Native graph managers own entity lookup, relationship hydration, temporal reads, exact lookup,
  graph traversal, and default graph writes.
- Native embedding service owns embedding model selection, cache behavior, vector writes, vector
  search, and eval metadata without Graphiti embedder interfaces.
- Archive import, rollback, and historical migration surfaces are file-based or explicitly
  configured. No default command reaches for ambient PostgreSQL or FalkorDB.
- Project-scoped memory cannot leak through REST, MCP, CLI, search, explore, context packs, wake,
  recall, or reflection promotion.
- Memory policy decisions are shared across API, CLI, MCP, raw memory, context packs, reflection,
  and task learning writes.
- Context packs, memory writes, and reflection promotion expose source IDs, visibility, freshness,
  and policy reason metadata that can be inspected and tested.
- Audit events record the actor, delegated authority, organization, project, memory scope, action,
  and policy decision for trust-sensitive memory operations.

Required release gates:

- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`
- `moon run core:test`
- `moon run api:test`
- `moon run cli:test`
- `moon run docs:lint`
- `moon run :check`
- `moon run baseline-seed`
- `moon run baseline-replay-runtime`
- `moon run core:bench-context -- --cases benchmarks/context_pack_cases.json --auth-manifest .moon/cache/baseline-runtime-manifest.json --label retrieval-compare --repeat 20 --metadata retrieval_mode=compare`
- CI green on `main`
- Nightly regression green on `main`

## 3. Non-Goals

- Do not build full `synthesize` in v0.8. This release prepares the trust and provenance substrate
  that `synthesize` will reuse.
- Do not build an arbitrary policy language. Keep policy as code plus simple data records until real
  usage requires more.
- Do not delete historical archive support before archive and rollback policy is explicit.
- Do not ship broad cross-organization sharing. v0.8 can support previews, stable deny reasons, and
  promotion foundations.
- Do not rebuild the entire web UI. Add only the minimal API and CLI inspection surfaces needed to
  prove trust behavior.
- Do not keep compatibility code just because tests still import it. Tests should move to named
  compatibility gates when the product no longer needs the path.

## 4. Track A: Pure Surreal Closure

Goal: make SurrealDB the only default data plane and make Graphiti a deliberate compatibility choice
rather than ambient scaffolding.

### Wave A0: Baseline Lock

Purpose: preserve the post-v0.7 green state before deleting or moving compatibility code.

Implementation:

- Record the current generated inventory, no-Graphiti smoke state, CI receipts, and dependency
  boundary in the v0.8 tracking epic.
- Add release-gate wording to the relevant docs if any current default-loop gate is missing.
- Confirm `graphiti-core` remains optional in runtime package metadata.
- Confirm scratch, generated, and benchmark artifacts are not accidentally pulled into commits.

Files:

- `docs/architecture/SURREALDB_GRAPHITI_EXIT_INVENTORY.md`
- `docs/architecture/SURREALDB_PHASE3_BURNDOWN.md`
- `docs/architecture/SIBYL_V08_PURE_SURREAL_CLOSURE_AND_MEMORY_TRUST_PLAN.md`

Verify:

- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`
- `moon run :check`

A0 receipt, 2026-05-13:

- Local commit: `1de0b408`.
- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`: current generated inventory, 21
  covered Graphiti import files, 14 passed, inventory typecheck passed.
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`: 2 passed.
- `moon run :check`: 33 completed, including 5 executed tasks and 28 cache hits. Core reported 1327
  passed and 15 skipped; API reported 1639 passed and 1 skipped; CLI reported 156 passed; web
  reported 88 passed.
- Dependency boundary: `graphiti-core` appears in `sibyl-core[compatibility]` and the `sibyl-core`
  dev dependency group, not default `sibyl-core` runtime dependencies.
- CI boundary: `origin/main` at `d2d3d926` has green CI and docs deploy runs from
  2026-05-13T13:24:12Z plus a green scheduled nightly from 2026-05-13T09:56:01Z. Local `main`
  remains ahead of `origin/main`, so this receipt does not claim CI coverage for the local commits.

Exit criteria:

- Baseline gates are green and documented.
- Any later wave can prove whether it reduced, preserved, or intentionally moved compatibility
  surface area.

### Wave A1: Graphiti Compatibility Quarantine

Purpose: make Graphiti importability explicit.

Implementation:

- Move Graphiti-dependent tests behind named compatibility tasks or markers.
- Ensure default test, lint, typecheck, API boot, CLI boot, MCP import, job import, and prompt-hook
  import do not rely on Graphiti being installed.
- Add an import-boundary test that fails if default modules import from the compatibility island.
- Introduce a narrow compatibility package or module boundary for remaining Graphiti adapters.
- Keep compatibility docs explicit about installation with `sibyl-core[compatibility]`.

- `docs/architecture/SURREALDB_GRAPHITI_EXIT_INVENTORY.md`

Verify:

- `uv lock --check`
- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`
- default `moon run core:test`
- compatibility test task when explicitly enabled

Exit criteria:

- Graphiti can be absent from a default development or production environment.
- Any test that needs Graphiti names that requirement in its task or marker.
- The inventory can distinguish default code from compatibility code.

### Wave A2: Native Graph Manager Replacement

Purpose: remove Graphiti-shaped entity and relationship read/write adapters from active graph
manager APIs.

Implementation:

- Replace remaining default uses of `EntityNode`, `EpisodicNode`, and Graphiti edge models with
  native Surreal record hydration.
- Move relationship CRUD to native `relates_to` and `mentions` managers.
- Move temporal reads to native relationship history helpers.
- Keep exact source IDs, confidence, validity, and provenance fields intact.
- Add model normalization fixtures for legacy row shapes and native row shapes.
- Remove Graphiti edge error handling from default API graph runtime.

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_graph_entities.py tests/test_graph_relationships.py`
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`

Exit criteria:

- Default graph manager APIs no longer require Graphiti node or edge classes.
- Native graph reads and writes cover the seeded behavior previously covered by Graphiti
  compatibility adapters.

### Wave A3: Native Embedding Ownership

Purpose: make embedding a Sibyl-native service, not a Graphiti-shaped adapter.

Implementation:

- Create a native embedding service with provider selection, dimensions, cache keys, and metadata.
- Move Gemini and OpenAI embedding support behind native provider implementations.
- Route native vector writes and vector search through the native service.
- Record embedding model, dimensions, provider, tokenizer estimate method, and index settings in
  eval reports.
- Keep old Graphiti-compatible embedders only inside the compatibility island until deletion.

- `moon run core:test -- tests/test_native_retrieval.py tests/test_graph_client.py`
- `moon run core:bench-context`
- `moon run baseline-seed`
- `moon run baseline-replay-runtime`

Exit criteria:

- Native paths do not import Graphiti embedder interfaces.
- Eval reports include deterministic embedding and tokenizer metadata.
- Compatibility embedders are isolated and removable.

### Wave A4: Graphiti Operations Island Or Deletion

Purpose: decide whether the Graphiti Surreal ops package remains as an optional compatibility
artifact or is removed.

Implementation:

- Audit `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/surreal/ops/*` after A1-A3.
- Delete modules with no compatibility owner.
- Move retained modules under a clearly named compatibility namespace if they still support
  migration, admin, or explicit compare workflows.
- Remove stale comments that imply Graphiti is the active graph runtime.
- Update inventory coverage rules after the package move or deletion.

Verify:

- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`
- compatibility test task when explicitly enabled
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`
- `moon run :check`

Exit criteria:

- Generated inventory has no unowned Graphiti imports.
- Remaining Graphiti code is either deleted or isolated as explicit compatibility.

### Wave A5: Legacy Archive, Coordination, And Docs Cleanup

Purpose: close the leftover operational ambiguity around legacy services.

Implementation:

- Settle archive policy for retained `postgres.sql` payloads and graph archive imports.
- Make archive import commands require explicit input files and mode flags.
- Ensure default backup/restore docs mention only supported Surreal archive flows.
- Confirm Redis/Valkey remains explicit coordination opt-in and is never implied as default data
  storage.
- Remove stale FalkorDB/PostgreSQL instructions from active docs, leaving only historical or
  migration-labeled guidance.
- Add inventory checks for any default-path drift not currently covered.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test`
- `moon run core:test`
- `moon run docs:lint`
- targeted `rg` audit for `postgres`, `falkor`, `redis`, `Graphiti`, and `graphiti`

Exit criteria:

- Default docs and default runtime no longer suggest legacy services.
- Migration and archive surfaces are explicit, file-based, and tested.
- Redis/Valkey is clearly coordination-only and opt-in.

### Wave A6: Pure Surreal Release Audit

Purpose: prove the release surface is coherent from a clean checkout.

Implementation:

- Run full local dev verification against SurrealDB only.
- Run inventory and dependency checks from a clean checkout.
- Run no-Graphiti smoke with Graphiti absent from the default environment.
- Audit docs, charts, compose, CI, package metadata, and release notes.
- Gate every citable AI-memory artifact with `bench-gate`.
- Record final CI and nightly receipts in Sibyl.

Verify:

- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`
- `moon run core:test`
- `moon run api:test`
- `moon run cli:test`

- `moon run core:bench-context -- --cases benchmarks/context_pack_cases.json --auth-manifest .moon/cache/baseline-runtime-manifest.json --label retrieval-compare --repeat 20 --metadata retrieval_mode=compare`
- CI green
- nightly regression green

Exit criteria:

- v0.8 can be released as a Surreal-only default runtime.
- Every retained compatibility surface is opt-in, documented, and tested separately.

## 5. Track B: Memory Trust Foundation

Goal: make Sibyl safe and inspectable enough for memory spaces, project privacy, delegated agents,
promotion, sharing previews, and future synthesis.

### Wave B0: Trust Surface Inventory

Purpose: lock the current policy and authorization reality before changing control-plane behavior.

Implementation:

- Reconcile `PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md` with the current Surreal auth/runtime code.
- Inventory REST, MCP, CLI, prompt hook, and job surfaces that read or write memory.
- Mark which surfaces carry user ID, agent identity, organization, project, memory scope, and
  membership context.
- Add missing test fixtures for project-private data and private memory leaks.

Files:

- `docs/architecture/PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/architecture/PERMISSION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/authorization.py`

Verify:

- `moon run core:test -- tests/test_memory_policy.py`
- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_context.py tests/test_routes_memory.py`

B0 inventory receipt, 2026-05-13:

- `docs/architecture/PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md` now has a Surreal auth reconciliation section and
  trust-surface inventory covering REST, MCP, CLI, prompt hook, and job memory paths.
- `docs/architecture/PERMISSION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` is explicitly marked as historical design context
  rather than current Postgres/RLS implementation guidance.
- Current green coverage already includes core memory policy tests, REST memory tests, REST context
  tests, and MCP accessible-project tests.
- Tracked implementation gaps:
  - B2 owns direct entity list/get project-private filtering, temporal search classification,
    raw-capture visibility classification, and project fallback retirement.
  - B3 owns canonical policy context across raw memory, context, MCP `add/manage`, CLI output, and
    async job payloads.
  - B4 owns inspect/audit output for allowed, denied, hidden, promoted, and source-derived memory.

Exit criteria:

- Every memory surface has an explicit policy-context status.
- Missing context is tracked as implementation work, not tribal knowledge.

### Wave B1: MemorySpace Control Plane

Purpose: introduce first-class memory spaces as policy boundaries.

Implementation:

- Add `MemorySpace` records to the Surreal auth/control plane.
- Model membership for private, delegated, project, team, organization, shared, and public scopes.
- Keep team, organization, shared, and public write/share behavior disabled until explicit policy
  cases are implemented.
- Project graph memory should resolve to a project memory space.
- Add graph projection only for explanation and traversal, not as the source of authorization truth.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_surreal_auth_persistence.py tests/test_routes_memory.py`
- `moon run core:test -- tests/test_memory_policy.py`

Exit criteria:

- Memory-space CRUD and membership basics exist.
- Policy helpers can resolve space visibility without graph lookups.
- Disabled scopes return stable deny reasons.

### Wave B2: Project RBAC Hardening

Purpose: close the known project authorization gaps before expanding sharing.

Implementation:

- Ensure graph project creation, rename, and archive synchronize canonical project control-plane
  records.
- Fix graph project ID versus internal project ID mismatches in project-member routes.
- Remove write-path fallbacks that allow missing or unregistered project metadata to bypass required
  roles.
- Ensure org membership is a precondition for project membership.
- Gate setup endpoints after initialization.
- Add owner/admin override tests and project-private negative tests.

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_entities.py tests/test_routes_entities_write.py`
- `moon run web:typecheck`

B2 progress receipt, 2026-05-13:

- `8199ddf1` filters REST entity list, direct entity reads, and related-summary hydration through
  accessible project IDs. Explicit list scopes now use the auth runtime verifier instead of local
  set membership, and project entities authorize against their own graph project IDs.
- `b9552139` removes write-path project fallbacks for entity, task, and epic mutations by requiring
  registered project records before project-scoped writes proceed.
- The tighter write gate exposed one real dogfood gap: existing graph projects can still lack
  canonical auth-control-plane `projects` records. The next B2 slice must add an owner/admin repair
  path that backfills records from graph project entities, then use that path to repair local
  dogfood data before relying on stricter enforcement.

B2 remaining slices:

1. Add a project-record sync and backfill surface for existing graph project entities.
2. Fix project-member routes so graph project IDs and auth project records resolve consistently.
3. Gate setup endpoints once initialization has completed.
4. Extend search, explore, context, and entity read tests with project-private deny fixtures.
5. Run the B2 route gate, web typecheck, full API policy slice, and independent review.

B2 closure update, 2026-05-13: all five slices above are implemented and verified in the packet
receipts below. Remaining trust work moves to B3/B4/B6 policy context, inspect/audit, and release
gate coverage.

Exit criteria:

- Project-private data does not leak through list, search, explore, or direct entity reads.
- Mutations require the right project role.
- Project membership management works with graph project IDs.

### Wave B3: Unified Policy Context For API, CLI, MCP, And Jobs

Purpose: make every integration call the same policy primitive.

Implementation:

- Extend MCP auth context with user ID, agent identity, delegated authority, org role, and
  accessible project IDs.
- Ensure MCP `remember`, `recall`, `context`, `reflect`, `search`, `explore`, and `manage` pass
  policy context into core services.
- Make CLI commands consume API policy decisions and reason strings instead of duplicating policy.
- Add job payload policy context for task-learning and reflection promotion writes.
- Add deny-case tests for missing agent identity, missing scope key, unverified membership, and
  scope crossing.

- `moon run cli:test`
- `moon run core:test -- tests/test_memory_policy.py`

Exit criteria:

- REST, CLI, MCP, and jobs produce matching allow and deny reasons.
- MCP no longer acts as an org-only bypass around project or memory-space policy.

### Wave B4: Audit And Inspect

Purpose: let humans and agents answer why a memory was shown, hidden, written, or promoted.

Implementation:

- Add memory audit events for remember, recall, wake, context pack render, reflect, promotion, share
  preview, and policy denies.
- Add an inspect API and CLI surface for source, derived records, visibility, freshness, policy
  reason, and actor metadata.
- Add redaction metadata for hidden-but-relevant context without leaking hidden text.
- Preserve raw source IDs and derived record IDs in audit and inspect responses.
- Keep audit storage bounded enough for local development.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_memory.py tests/test_routes_context.py`
- `moon run cli:test`
- `moon run core:test`

Exit criteria:

- Context-pack and memory-write decisions are inspectable.
- Audit events carry actor, scope, source, and policy metadata.
- Hidden relevant context can be indicated without leaking sensitive text.

### Wave B5: Promotion And Share Preview

Purpose: prepare controlled movement from private memory into shared contexts without shipping
unbounded sharing.

Implementation:

- Add promotion preview for private to project, delegated to project, and project to organization
  candidate moves.
- Require explicit target scope and target memory space for every promotion.
- Return stable allow/deny reasons before any write.
- Add share-preview response shape with redactions, hidden-but-relevant counts, and source IDs.

Exit criteria:

- Promotion previews are policy-backed and source-grounded.
- Mixed-scope promotion denies unless the target scope is explicit and allowed.
- Private-leak fixtures remain at zero leaks.

### Wave B6: Memory Trust Release Gate

Purpose: prove the trust layer before post-v0.8 product expansion.

Implementation:

- Run no-leak fixtures across raw memory, context pack, wake, recall, reflect, MCP, and CLI.
- Verify project-private fixtures through REST and MCP.
- Verify audit/inspect receipts for allow and deny cases.
- Verify every trust-sensitive surface returns stable reason codes.
- Record final gate artifacts in Sibyl.

Verify:

- `moon run core:test`
- `moon run api:test`
- `moon run cli:test`
- `moon run core:bench-context`
- `moon run :check`
- CI green
- nightly regression green

Exit criteria:

- v0.8 can claim project-scoped, policy-backed, inspectable memory behavior.
- `synthesize`, sharing UX, and larger personal-corpus import can build on a stable trust layer.

## 6. Suggested Execution Order

1. A0: lock post-v0.7 baseline.
2. B0: update trust inventory against current code.
3. A1: quarantine Graphiti compatibility.
4. B1: introduce memory spaces as policy boundaries.
5. B2: harden project RBAC and setup routes.
6. A2: replace Graphiti-shaped native graph managers.
7. A3: move embeddings to native ownership.
8. B3: unify policy context across API, CLI, MCP, and jobs.
9. B4: add audit and inspect surfaces.
10. A4: delete or move Graphiti ops into a compatibility island.
11. A5: close archive, coordination, and stale docs cleanup.
12. B5: add promotion and share preview.
13. A6 and B6: run release audits together.

A0 and B0 can run in parallel. A2/A3 and B1/B2 touch different centers and can also run in parallel
if agents have disjoint write ownership. B3 should wait for B1 and B2. A4 should wait for A1, A2,
and A3.

## 7. Task Tracking Shape

Sibyl tracking:

- Epic: `v0.8 Pure Surreal Closure`
  - ID: `epic_416f955f7f39`
  - Task `cc561455-0b5f-43a5-a266-2e7852593edc`: lock v0.8 baseline gates
  - Task `25c702de-95e5-452c-8705-d63389aea038`: quarantine Graphiti compatibility
  - Task `1fb2a343-6fc8-4f45-936c-2c0f895009b2`: replace Graphiti-shaped graph managers
  - Task `03e4a386-a556-497b-86bc-b5430e044905`: move embeddings to native ownership
  - Task `61515e7a-f4fd-4ab7-a41f-b8789bf69272`: delete or isolate Graphiti ops package
  - Task `bcfef650-1087-454e-aa30-be3a6bbc9b8a`: close archive, coordination, and legacy docs
    residue
  - Task `1114d0bb-0acc-443a-ab0d-1a830036a9b5`: run pure Surreal release audit
- Epic: `v0.8 Memory Trust Foundation`
  - ID: `epic_539eea7afeb3`
  - Task `373c0eae-fef4-4822-9130-481193d50454`: inventory trust-sensitive memory surfaces
  - Task `00a3beff-88d5-45d3-b5aa-dc52f01cb87a`: add memory-space control plane
  - Task `0b7851f7-44c9-41e5-8036-7bd641d554aa`: harden project RBAC
  - Task `e4a44b56-10f1-4411-a677-5606920c0576`: unify API, CLI, MCP, and job policy context
  - Task `32d31cf2-70b4-4869-b683-8a6fcb5a8220`: add memory audit and inspect surfaces
  - Task `18fd25d9-e3cb-4798-b789-a09dba5e4e08`: add promotion and share preview
  - Task `f66e6310-8c3e-410e-805f-36c52d823910`: run memory trust release gate

Each task should complete with:

- changed files
- exact verification command receipts
- policy or compatibility decisions made
- any remaining risk or deferred follow-up

Tracking integrity follow-up:

- Task `a03051b5-4ac8-449f-b38a-ddb1974f5523`: fix epic progress aggregation for direct task
  tracking. New v0.8 tasks are linked to epics, but `sibyl epic show` currently reports `0/0` totals
  for the new epics. A0/B0 can start while this is tracked, but release receipts should not rely on
  epic rollups until this is fixed or explicitly accounted for.

| Compatibility code still imports Graphiti on default paths | Default installs become fragile and larger than advertised | Keep no-Graphiti smoke and inventory gates blocking               |
| Native graph replacements lose legacy visibility           | Older records may disappear from recall                    | Preserve legacy projection rules and fixture native hydration     |
| Embedding metadata drift makes evals noisy                 | Quality gates become untrustworthy                         | Record provider, model, dimensions, tokenizer, and index settings |

| Audit logging becomes too heavy for local use              | Trust features should not slow every recall                | Keep initial audit events compact and queryable by source/action  |

## 10. Open Questions

These should be answered during B0/A0 before broad implementation:

- Should `organization` memory scope become readable in v0.8, or remain disabled until explicit
  organization memory spaces ship?
- Should project-private graph entities without registered project records be denied for all
  non-admin users, or migrated automatically before enforcement?
- Should Graphiti compatibility remain in this repository as an optional extra after v0.8, or move
  to an archive branch once A4 is complete?
- How long should retained `postgres.sql` restore support remain available after v0.8?
- Should audit events for context-pack reads store item IDs only, or item IDs plus compact reason
  metadata?
- Should share preview land in CLI first, API first, or both?

## 11. Post-v0.8 Bridge

v0.8 should leave the system ready for:

- `synthesize`: source-grounded large-read artifacts from policy-filtered graph slices.
- Human trust UI: inspect, correct, hide, promote, redact, export, and delete memory.
- Team/shared memory spaces: deliberate sharing with previews and audit trail.
- Personal corpus ingestion: staged import for email, chat, notes, docs, and home-assistant memory.
- Live memory cockpit: live capture feed, reflection progress, context-pack preview, and
  permission-change invalidation.

The sequencing matters. `synthesize` and sharing become powerful only after policy, provenance,
audit, and inspection are boring.

## 12. Execution Operating Model

This plan should be implemented as small, reviewable commits. Each commit should retire one release
risk and include the tests that prove it. When a wave needs multiple commits, use this loop:

1. Re-read the wave purpose, exit criteria, and current tracked task.
2. Map the touched files before editing and leave unrelated work alone.
3. Implement one narrow behavior change.
4. Run the tightest useful test first, then the wave gate when the slice is stable.
5. Commit with a Conventional Commit subject and a body that explains why the change matters.
6. Capture the learning or decision in Sibyl when the slice changes policy, compatibility, or
   operational behavior.

Non-trivial implementation slices require independent adversarial review before the task is reported
complete. The reviewer should receive the original wave goal, changed files, verification receipts,
and the expected deny or compatibility behavior. A self-check is useful, but it does not replace
that review.

## 13. Atomic Implementation Packets

These packets are the preferred order for the next execution pass. They are smaller than the waves
above so they can land cleanly.

### Packet B2.1: Project Record Backfill

Purpose: repair existing graph projects that predate canonical auth project records.

Files:

- `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/admin.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/surreal/auth_runtime.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/auth_runtime.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_routes_admin.py`
- `docs/architecture/PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`

Implementation:

- Add an owner/admin-only dry-run and apply surface that lists graph project entities missing auth
  `projects` records.
- Create missing records with the acting owner/admin as owner, organization visibility, and viewer
  default role.
- Report created, existing, skipped, and failed project IDs without leaking private project content.
- Document when to run the repair and why stricter write gates depend on it.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_admin.py tests/test_surreal_auth_runtime.py`
- `moon run api:lint api:typecheck`
- Dry-run locally before any data write.

Exit criteria:

- Existing graph projects can be repaired without weakening `require_existing_project=True`.
- Local dogfood data can pass stricter project write gates after the repair is applied.

Receipt, 2026-05-13:

- Commit: `406d7cd9`.
- Changed files:
  - `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/admin.py`
  - `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/schemas.py`
  - `apps/api/tests/test_routes_admin.py`
  - `docs/architecture/PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`
- Verification:
  - `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_admin.py tests/test_surreal_auth_runtime.py` -> 66
    passed in 1.41s.
  - `moon run api:lint api:typecheck` -> lint passed; typecheck exited 0 with the existing 63 ty
    warnings.
  - `moon run docs:lint` -> passed.
- Review: Claude cross-model review PASS at
  `/tmp/claude-review-b21-project-record-backfill-1778708133.txt`.
- Remaining risk: live dogfood data still needs a dry-run and explicit apply decision before the
  linked project can use project-scoped writes again.

### Packet B2.2: Project Member Graph-ID Resolution

Purpose: make membership routes use the same graph project ID contract as entity and task routes.

Files:

- `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/project_members.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/surreal/auth_runtime.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_project_members.py`

Implementation:

- Accept graph project IDs at route boundaries where the UI and CLI already use them.
- Resolve graph IDs to canonical auth project records before membership reads or writes.
- Require org membership before project membership can be granted.
- Preserve owner/admin overrides while denying unrelated org users.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_project_members.py`
- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_route_access_seams.py`

Exit criteria:

- Project member management works against graph project IDs.
- Missing project records fail closed with stable reason or status.

Receipt, 2026-05-13:

- Commit: `d0cdea07`.
- Changed files:
  - `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/surreal/organization_runtime.py`
  - `apps/api/tests/test_organization_runtime.py`
- Verification:
  - `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_project_members.py tests/test_organization_runtime.py`
    -> 40 passed in 1.21s.
  - `moon run api:lint api:typecheck` -> lint passed; typecheck exited 0 with the existing 63 ty
    warnings.
- Review: Claude cross-model review PASS at
  `/tmp/claude-review-b22-project-members-org-invariant-1778708649.txt`.
- Remaining risk: removing an org member still needs a cleanup or cascade follow-up for stale
  `project_members` rows; the route now filters stale rows and still allows explicit removal.

### Packet B2.3: Setup Endpoint Gate

Purpose: prevent setup routes from becoming a post-initialization privilege bypass.

Files:

- `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/setup.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/setup_common.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/surreal/setup.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_setup_routes.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_surreal_setup.py`
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`
- `apps/web/src/app/setup/page.tsx`

Implementation:

- Gate setup actions after the first owner/admin organization is initialized.
- Keep first-run setup ergonomic for a clean local install.
- Return explicit already-initialized errors to the web client.
- Ensure web setup handling does not treat the gate as a generic network failure.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_setup_routes.py`
- `moon run web:typecheck`

Exit criteria:

- Setup succeeds for a new install and denies after initialization.
- The web client can display or handle the initialized state cleanly.

B2.3 receipt, 2026-05-13:

- Setup mode now closes only after an owner/admin organization membership exists. This keeps partial
  first-run states recoverable when users or organizations exist without an initialized owner/admin
  org.
- `/setup/status` returns `setup_complete` and sets `needs_setup` from that initialized-org
  invariant. Public key validation through `validate_keys=true` is ignored once setup is complete so
  the status route cannot be used for unauthenticated external API pressure.
- `/setup/validate-keys` now uses the setup-or-owner/admin dependency instead of setup-or-any-auth.
- Setup/admin gating now accepts organization owner/admin roles after initialization and returns a
  structured `setup_already_initialized` detail when an initialized instance is hit without a token.
- The web setup page recognizes the initialized setup error and redirects to login rather than
  rendering the generic connection failure state.
- Review: Claude cross-model review PASS at `/tmp/claude-review-b23-setup-gate-1778710000.txt`; the
  public `/setup/status?validate_keys=true` follow-up was fixed before commit and re-reviewed as
  PASS at `/tmp/claude-review-b23-setup-gate-followup-1778710500.txt`.
- Verification:
  - `moon run api:test -- tests/test_setup_routes.py tests/test_surreal_setup.py`: 11 passed in
    1.13s.
  - `moon run api:test -- tests/test_setup_routes.py tests/test_surreal_setup.py tests/test_settings_routes.py tests/test_operations_runtime.py`:
    23 passed in 1.18s after the review follow-up.
  - `moon run web:test -- src/lib/api.test.ts`: 1 file and 3 tests passed.
  - `moon run api:lint api:typecheck`: lint passed; typecheck exited 0 with the existing 63 ty
    warnings.
  - `moon run web:typecheck`: types generated successfully.
  - `moon run web:lint`: checked 221 files with no fixes applied.

### Packet B2.4: Project-Private Leak Fixtures

Purpose: prove read-side project filtering across every B2 surface.

Files:

- `apps/api/tests/test_routes_entities.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_routes_entities_read.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_routes_search.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_routes_context.py`

Implementation:

- Add fixtures with private project entities, unassigned entities, inaccessible project entities,
  and project entities whose own ID is the project scope.
- Cover list, direct get, search, related summaries, and context-pack candidate hydration.
- Assert hidden results are absent and deny responses carry stable status or reason.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_entities.py tests/test_routes_entities_read.py`
- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_search.py tests/test_routes_context.py`

Exit criteria:

- No project-private fixture leaks through the B2 read surfaces.
- Tests cover both implicit accessible-project scopes and explicit requested project scopes.

B2.4 receipt, 2026-05-13:

- Added a shared core project-policy helper that treats project entities as scoped by their own
  graph entity ID when `project_id` metadata is absent.
- Search, explore list, explore related/traverse, explore dependencies, and context-pack related
  hydration now use project-aware policy IDs for project filters and accessible-project filters.
- REST explore multi-project filters now verify each requested project through
  `verify_entity_project_access()` instead of comparing against the default accessible-project set.
- Added no-leak fixtures for entity list, direct entity related hydration, search/explore route
  policy plumbing, core search/explore project entities, explore related/traverse, explore
  dependencies, and context-pack related hydration.
- Review: Claude cross-model review initially failed on explore related/traverse project-entity
  filtering, then passed after that fix. A final pass also verified the dependencies-mode follow-up:
  `/tmp/claude-review-b24-project-private-fixtures-final-1778781400.txt`.
- Verification:
  - `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_entities.py tests/test_routes_entities_read.py`: 26
    passed in 1.25s.
  - `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_search.py tests/test_routes_context.py`: 19 passed in
    1.28s.
  - `moon run core:test -- tests/test_tools.py tests/test_context_pack.py`: 1331 passed and 15
    skipped in 8.78s.
  - `moon run api:lint api:typecheck`: lint passed; typecheck exited 0 with the existing 63 ty
    warnings.
  - `moon run core:lint core:typecheck`: lint passed; typecheck exited 0 with the existing 26 ty
    warnings.
  - `git diff --check`: passed.

B2.5 route gate receipt, 2026-05-13:

- Route-gate coverage includes project-record backfill, project members, search/explore, entity
  list/get/write, setup gating, and context/reflect route policy plumbing.
- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_admin.py tests/test_routes_project_members.py tests/test_routes_search.py`:
  35 passed in 1.25s.
- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_entities.py tests/test_routes_entities_read.py tests/test_routes_entities_write.py tests/test_setup_routes.py tests/test_surreal_setup.py tests/test_routes_context.py`:
  58 passed in 1.25s.
- `moon run web:typecheck`: types generated successfully from cache.
- Independent review for the final B2.4/B2.5 policy closure passed at
  `/tmp/claude-review-b24-project-private-fixtures-final-1778781400.txt`.

### Packet B3.1: Policy Context Contract

Purpose: define the shared payload that REST, MCP, CLI, jobs, and core services pass around.

Files:

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/auth/context.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/auth/memory_policy.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/mcp_auth.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/server.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_memory_policy.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_mcp_auth.py`

Implementation:

- Add fields for actor user ID, agent identity, delegated authority, organization role, project
  access, memory space, and source surface.
- Make missing actor, missing scope, and unverified membership produce stable deny reasons.
- Route MCP auth through the same context model used by REST.

Verify:

- `moon run core:test -- tests/test_memory_policy.py`
- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_mcp_auth.py tests/test_server_accessible_projects.py`

Exit criteria:

- Policy decisions can be compared across REST and MCP without special-case translation.

B3.1 receipt, 2026-05-13:

- Added `MemoryPolicyContext` as the shared actor, organization role, project access, delegation,
  memory-space, scope-key, agent, and source-surface payload for memory policy calls.
- REST raw memory routes and MCP remember authorization now evaluate memory writes/reads through the
  shared policy context while preserving legacy `authorize_memory_*` kwargs callers.
- Stable deny guards now cover missing actors, missing memory space, missing project/delegation
  scope keys, and unverified project/delegation membership.
- `moon run core:test -- tests/test_memory_policy.py tests/test_auth_contracts.py`: 1340 passed, 15
  skipped in 8.83s.
- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_memory.py tests/test_server_accessible_projects.py tests/test_auth_mcp_token_verifier.py`:
  42 passed in 1.28s.
- `moon run core:lint core:typecheck`: lint passed; typecheck exited 0 with the existing 26 ty
  diagnostics.
- `moon run api:lint api:typecheck`: lint passed; typecheck exited 0 with the existing 63 ty
  diagnostics.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Independent review passed at `/tmp/claude-review-b31-policy-context-1778713220.txt`; follow-up
  regression tests were added for the review's test-gap notes.

### Packet B4.1: Audit Event Skeleton

Purpose: give memory trust work one compact audit record before adding more surfaces.

Files:

- `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/surreal/auth_runtime.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/auth_runtime.py`
- `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/memory.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_routes_memory.py`

Implementation:

- Persist compact audit events for remember, recall/context render, reflect, promotion preview, and
  policy deny decisions.
- Include actor, organization, project or memory space, action, source IDs, derived IDs, policy
  decision, and reason.
- Keep event payloads bounded and queryable by actor, action, source, and time.

Verify:

- `moon run api:test -- tests/test_routes_memory.py`
- `moon run core:test -- tests/test_memory_policy.py`

Exit criteria:

- At least one allowed case and one denied case produce inspectable audit receipts.

## 14. Evidence Ledger

Every wave should leave a receipt block in this document or in the corresponding audit doc. Use this
shape so release notes can be assembled without archaeology:

```text
Wave:
Commit:
Date:
Changed files:
Verification:
  - command -> result
Review:
  - reviewer/tool -> PASS/FAIL and file path
Policy or compatibility decision:
Remaining risk:
Sibyl memory:
```

Release evidence must distinguish local receipts from CI receipts. A local green `main` is not the
same as a pushed green `origin/main`; CI and nightly run IDs should be recorded before release
claims are made.

## 15. Release Review

Before cutting v0.8, run one explicit review over the whole release:

- Confirm every required release gate in section 2 has a current receipt.
- Confirm all Graphiti imports are either deleted or owned by a named compatibility island.
- Confirm no default docs mention FalkorDB, PostgreSQL, or Redis/Valkey as required data services.
- Confirm MemorySpace, project RBAC, policy context, audit, and inspect surfaces fail closed.
- Confirm project-private leak fixtures pass through REST, MCP, CLI, context, wake, recall, and
  reflection promotion paths.
- Confirm benchmark and AI-memory claims only cite artifacts that pass their gates.
- Confirm Sibyl tasks and decisions carry the final receipts and residual risks.

The release recommendation should be binary: ship v0.8 or hold it. If the answer is hold, name the
smallest blocking packet and the command that will prove it is fixed.
