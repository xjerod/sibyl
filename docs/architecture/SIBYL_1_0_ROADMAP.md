# Sibyl 1.0 Roadmap

- Status: active planning baseline
- Created: 2026-05-15
- Current release floor: v0.9.0
- Current implementation focus: v0.12 Reflection OS
- Tracking task: `b4061098-bf23-44e3-a164-006501345863`

## 1. Thesis

Sibyl 1.0 is not a bigger review queue. It is the point where Sibyl becomes an automatic memory
operating system for agents and humans.

Routine memory work should run by default:

1. Capture source material.
2. Preserve provenance and policy context.
3. Consolidate noisy traces into durable memory.
4. Detect duplicates, contradictions, stale facts, and sensitive material.
5. Promote safe memory into the right space.
6. Keep recall, synthesis, and task context current.
7. Ask humans only for exceptions.

The product promise is simple: an agent can enter a workspace, get the right bounded context, do
real work, and leave the graph smarter without Bliss babysitting a manual inbox.

## 2. Active Source Docs

These living docs in `docs/architecture/` remain active planning inputs:

- [`SIBYL_NORTHSTAR.md`](SIBYL_NORTHSTAR.md): product and architecture truth.
- [`SIBYL_V012_REFLECTION_OS_PLAN.md`](SIBYL_V012_REFLECTION_OS_PLAN.md): current v0.12 Reflection
  OS implementation plan.
- [`PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`](PERMISSION_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md): current auth, policy, project RBAC,
  MCP, and trust-surface audit.
- [`TASKIQ_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](TASKIQ_MIGRATION_PLAN.md): coordination backend boundary and
  Redis-optional local runtime direction.

These docs are release receipts or historical execution plans. They moved to `docs/_archive/` once
their work shipped. They can still hold useful receipts and design contracts, but they do not
override this roadmap or the Northstar when release status has changed:

- [`SIBYL_POST_V08_SYNTHESIS_AND_MEMORY_WORKSPACE_PLAN.md`](../_archive/SIBYL_POST_V08_SYNTHESIS_AND_MEMORY_WORKSPACE_PLAN.md):
  source-grounded synthesis, inspect, correction, import, and workspace product contracts shipped in
  v0.9.
- [`SIBYL_LLM_SUBSTRATE_PLAN.md`](../_archive/SIBYL_LLM_SUBSTRATE_PLAN.md): native model provider
  substrate landed in v0.10.
- [`SURREALDB_GRAPHITI_EXIT_BENCHMARK_EVIDENCE.md`](../_archive/SURREALDB_GRAPHITI_EXIT_BENCHMARK_EVIDENCE.md):
  benchmark evidence and public-claim rules.
- [`SURREALDB_NATIVE_MEMORY_CORE_SPEC.md`](../_archive/SURREALDB_NATIVE_MEMORY_CORE_SPEC.md)
- [`SURREALDB_V07_GRAPHITI_EXIT_AND_PURE_SURREAL_PLAN.md`](../_archive/SURREALDB_V07_GRAPHITI_EXIT_AND_PURE_SURREAL_PLAN.md)
- [`SIBYL_V08_PURE_SURREAL_CLOSURE_AND_MEMORY_TRUST_PLAN.md`](../_archive/SIBYL_V08_PURE_SURREAL_CLOSURE_AND_MEMORY_TRUST_PLAN.md)
- [`SIBYL_V08_PURE_SURREAL_CLOSURE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`](../_archive/SIBYL_V08_PURE_SURREAL_CLOSURE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)
- [`SURREALDB_PHASE1_BUGS.md`](../_archive/SURREALDB_PHASE1_BUGS.md)
- [`SURREALDB_PHASE2_AUTH_MIGRATION.md`](../_archive/SURREALDB_PHASE2_AUTH_MIGRATION.md)
- [`SURREALDB_PHASE2_LIVE_GATES.md`](../_archive/SURREALDB_PHASE2_LIVE_GATES.md)
- [`SURREALDB_PHASE3_BURNDOWN.md`](../_archive/SURREALDB_PHASE3_BURNDOWN.md)

## 3. 1.0 Definition

Sibyl 1.0 is ready when all of these are true:

- `wake`, `recall`, `remember`, `reflect`, `synthesize`, `inspect`, and `share preview` form one
  coherent product loop across API, CLI, MCP, prompt hooks, jobs, and web.
- Routine memory capture and consolidation are automatic-first. Humans only review policy
  exceptions, ambiguous contradictions, sensitive data, destructive actions, and high-impact
  sharing.
- Every derived memory has source IDs, policy receipts, confidence/freshness metadata, and rollback
  or correction history.
- Context packs explain inclusion, visibility, redaction, confidence, freshness, and hidden-but-
  relevant signals.
- Memory spaces are persisted control-plane records with users, agents, delegated authority,
  memberships, API-key restrictions, and audit trails.
- Project-private, delegated, and personal memory cannot leak through REST, CLI, MCP, web, prompt
  hooks, background jobs, imports, synthesis, or overview routes.
- Source import is resumable, deduplicated, inspectable, private by default, and searchable before
  expensive extraction finishes.
- Synthesis produces Markdown and JSON artifacts from authorized graph slices with section-level
  source IDs, unsupported-claim reporting, redaction metadata, and artifact provenance.
- The web Memory Workspace is the command center and exception console, not a manual approval
  treadmill.
- CLI auth and API sessions are boring: long-lived local CLI work should not require surprise
  re-login during normal use.
- Overview, metrics, context, and memory routes have measured latency budgets and do not run
  unbounded repeated graph scans while idle.
- SurrealDB is the only required default data plane. Graphiti is gone entirely from the supported
  runtime: no `graphiti-core` dependency, no `graphiti_core` imports, no compatibility extra, and no
  Graphiti-shaped fallback path.
- Default install, local dev, CI, Docker, Helm, and docs agree.

## 4. Workstreams

### W1. Autonomy Core

Build the automatic memory decision engine:

- score memory candidates for confidence, scope, sensitivity, duplication, contradiction, freshness,
  and blast radius
- auto-promote safe candidates through the same policy-backed path humans can inspect
- route only exceptions to review
- record every decision as an audit receipt with source IDs, reasons, model/provider, thresholds,
  and rollback metadata
- support dry-run and evidence modes for rollout and tests without making dry-run the product path

Exit criteria:

- a normal coding session can produce durable task learnings and project memories without manual
  approval
- exception queues stay small and explain why each item needs attention
- rollback or correction changes future recall and synthesis

### W2. Context Runtime

Make `wake`, `recall`, and `deep_search` explicit bounded products:

- enforce token and latency budgets per layer
- make source, confidence, visibility, freshness, and redaction reasons visible in every pack
- keep weak signals as boosts unless they are hard policy filters
- add dogfood fixtures that measure whether agents avoid rediscovery and ask fewer repeated
  questions
- fix overview and metrics routes so idle pages do not create slow-query storms

Exit criteria:

- overview page load and idle refresh have a budgeted query plan
- context-pack regressions fail named gates
- pack output is explainable enough for a human or agent to debug why context appeared

### W3. Trust And Control Plane

Make identity, policy, delegation, and audit first-class:

- persisted `MemorySpace` records and membership APIs
- first-class `Agent` identity and delegated authority
- API-key project and memory-space restrictions enforced at request time
- MCP `add` and `manage` either route through memory policy or fail closed for memory-sensitive
  actions
- job payloads carry actor, project, scope, policy receipt, and source IDs
- session refresh and CLI token behavior have regression coverage

Exit criteria:

- a restricted API key, delegated agent, project viewer, project maintainer, owner, and outsider all
  have tested recall/write behavior
- auth/session failures are observable and recoverable without silent local state corruption
- audit and inspect tell the same story across REST, CLI, MCP, jobs, and web

### W4. Reflection Intelligence

Turn reflection into a real consolidation loop:

- extract claims, decisions, plans, procedures, artifacts, tasks, and relationships
- detect duplicates and near-duplicates
- detect contradictions and stale facts
- mark supersession and freshness
- keep private, project, team, and organization rollups separate unless policy allows merging
- promote diary and session learnings through policy-backed reflection instead of direct shared
  writes

Exit criteria:

- repeated sessions converge instead of accreting noise
- contradiction and staleness flows create actionable exceptions, not silent graph drift
- reflection output improves recall quality in dogfood fixtures

### W5. Source And Synthesis Scale

Make sources and generated artifacts trustworthy at scale:

- stabilize the source adapter contract
- broaden import targets beyond mailbox-style archives
- make import status, dedupe, skipped records, attachments, and extraction state visible
- harden section-pack materialization
- verify citations, hidden-source handling, unsupported claims, and freshness
- remember generated artifacts with provenance back to source memory

Exit criteria:

- a large private corpus can be imported, resumed, searched, inspected, corrected, and synthesized
  without leaking into project memory
- every synthesized section has source IDs or explicit gaps
- correction and redaction affect future synthesis

### W6. Native LLM Substrate

Centralize model access so extraction, reflection, synthesis, and hooks use one runtime:

- one `sibyl_core.llm` provider layer
- curated model registry
- per-surface defaults and overrides
- settings API and web configuration
- key validation through current provider models
- token, latency, retry, model, and provider observability

Exit criteria:

- no active extraction, reflection, synthesis, or hook call site instantiates provider SDK clients
  directly
- model changes are testable per surface
- extraction and synthesis smoke runs preserve current field coverage and quality

### W7. Product Surface

Make the Memory Workspace feel like the real product:

- exception console for automatic memory decisions
- source inspect and correction from one place
- import progress and synthesis runs in one flow
- agent access preview and policy explanations
- fast overview panels with useful default density
- CLI commands that use the same vocabulary as the web UI

Exit criteria:

- a human can understand what Sibyl did automatically, correct it, undo it, and preview who can see
  it without learning graph internals
- the default screen is useful for repeated work, not a marketing surface or a manual queue

### W8. Runtime, Distribution, And Evidence

Make 1.0 shippable outside Bliss's terminal:

- Surreal-only default deployment
- Graphiti removed entirely from supported runtime, package metadata, optional extras, import
  allowlists, and compatibility tests
- legacy Graphiti-shaped archives imported through Sibyl-owned readers that do not import
  `graphiti_core`
- backup and restore round-trips for auth, graph, content, raw memory, tasks, and settings
- Docker, Helm, Homebrew, and docs match the same install story
- local coordination works for single-machine installs; Redis remains opt-in for distributed runs
- benchmark and release claim ledgers stay artifact-first

Exit criteria:

- a fresh install can run with only SurrealDB as the required data service
- release notes cite gates and artifacts, not vibes
- public performance or quality claims only cite accepted benchmark rows

### W9. Graphiti Deletion

Delete Graphiti as a product and dependency concern, not merely as a default-loop concern:

- replace remaining Graphiti-shaped entity, episode, relationship, search, extraction, embedder,
  maintenance, and restore adapters with Sibyl-native services
- delete `graphiti_core` imports and the generated allowlist entries that currently classify them
- delete the `sibyl-core[compatibility]` extra and any dev-only Graphiti dependency once replacement
  tests exist
- replace compatibility tests with native archive/import regression tests
- keep legacy data readability through explicit projection/import code owned by Sibyl
- keep benchmark baselines as archived artifacts, not live Graphiti runtime paths

Exit criteria:

- `rg "graphiti_core|graphiti-core"` returns only historical docs, archived benchmark notes, or
  explicit migration-format labels
- no Python package metadata, lockfile default set, optional extra, test dependency group, Docker,
  Helm, CI, or dev command installs Graphiti
- no application, CLI, MCP, worker, crawler, prompt hook, backup, restore, or test helper imports
  `graphiti_core`
- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test` fails on any new Graphiti import or
  dependency
- no-Graphiti smoke becomes a deletion proof, not just a default-loop proof

## 5. Milestone Stack

### v0.10: Autonomy And Runtime Pain

Goal: make the system less needy immediately.

- fix overview and metrics slow-query behavior
- fix CLI auth/session churn and add regression coverage
- land the automatic memory decision engine
- add exception-only review queue semantics
- start the native LLM substrate foundation

Required gates:

- existing `memory-trust-gate`
- new autonomy decision fixtures
- targeted auth/session tests
- targeted overview/perf receipts

### v0.11: Trust And Control Plane

Goal: make shared memory spaces and delegated agents safe enough for default use.

- persisted MemorySpace CRUD and membership
- agent identity and delegated authority
- API-key project and memory-space restrictions
- MCP `add/manage` policy closure
- job payload policy receipts
- complete inspect/audit parity

Required gates:

- project/private leak fixtures across REST, CLI, MCP, web, jobs, and prompt hooks
- API-key and delegated-agent deny cases
- inspect/audit consistency fixtures

### v0.12: Reflection OS

Goal: make memory consolidate itself.

- active plan: [`SIBYL_V012_REFLECTION_OS_PLAN.md`](SIBYL_V012_REFLECTION_OS_PLAN.md)
- first-class claim and reflection-finding lifecycle records
- contradiction, staleness, and duplicate detection
- supersession and rollback propagation
- automatic diary/session learning promotion
- dream-cycle style consolidation jobs
- recall quality evaluation against dogfood fixtures
- minimum CLI/web visibility for automatic decisions and exception routing

Required gates:

- new `reflection-quality-gate`
- correction and rollback fixtures
- source-grounding and permission-safety checks

First implementation slice landed:

- claim/finding/lifecycle records, structured extractor fixtures, and lifecycle decisions
- org-scoped reflection dream-cycle job with scheduled all-org maintenance
- queue, API, CLI, and web receipts for automatic promotion and exception routing
- `reflection-quality-gate` now runs core, API, CLI, and web reflection-quality slices
- dogfood recall-improvement fixture covers decision, procedure, task learning, stale claim,
  duplicate suppression, supersession exclusion, and private sensitive-note exclusion
- v0.12 release-matrix pass is green across reflection quality, autonomy, memory trust, trust
  control, auth/session, synthesis, adapter ingest, and overview performance

### v0.13: Source And Synthesis Scale

Goal: make source-grounded outputs reliable on real corpora.

- broader source adapters
- import observability and resumability hardening
- section-pack quality improvements
- synthesis verification expansion
- artifact remember and correction propagation

Required gates:

- `adapter-ingest-gate`
- `synthesis-gate`
- large-corpus import rehearsal
- hidden-source and unsupported-claim fixtures

### v0.14: Product And Distribution

Goal: make Sibyl feel like a polished local-first product.

- Memory Workspace polish and exception console
- CLI simplification
- first-run setup and settings polish
- backup/restore and migration docs
- Docker, Helm, Homebrew, and install path hardening
- full docs consolidation

Required gates:

- browser/workspace trust-flow checks
- docs lint and install rehearsal
- backup/restore round-trip
- `moon run :check`

### v1.0 RC

Goal: freeze the claim surface and cut only when receipts are boring.

- no stale release docs
- all active architecture docs agree
- Graphiti gone from supported runtime and package dependency graph
- Surreal-only default deployment
- benchmark ledger current
- auth, retrieval, memory trust, synthesis, source ingest, overview performance, and product flows
  have current receipts

Release decision format:

```text
Ship v1.0:
  yes/no
Blocking packet:
  smallest remaining blocker, if no
Proof command:
  command or external receipt that will prove the blocker closed
Residual risk:
  accepted risks with owners
```

## 6. New Gates To Add

Current gates remain useful, but 1.0 needs named gates that map to product claims:

- `autonomy-gate`: auto-promotion decisions, exception routing, rollback metadata, and dry-run
  parity
- `auth-session-gate`: CLI refresh behavior, revoked sessions, API keys, MCP tokens, and delegated
  agents
- `context-quality-gate`: wake/recall/deep_search quality, token budgets, latency budgets, and
  source metadata
- `reflection-quality-gate`: duplicate, contradiction, stale, supersession, and correction behavior
- `overview-perf-gate`: overview page and metrics API query count and latency budgets
- `workspace-trust-gate`: browser-visible inspect, correction, promotion preview, import progress,
  synthesis verification, and exception-console flows

These should become Moon tasks once the first implementation slice lands.

## 7. Strategic Boundary

The Gradial Rust direction can share design DNA, primitives, and evaluation fixtures with Sibyl, but
it should not derail Python Sibyl's 1.0. Sibyl remains the polished personal/team memory product.
Gradial can explore high-throughput swarm architecture separately.

Shared:

- `wake`, `recall`, `remember`, `reflect`, `synthesize`, `inspect`, `share`, and `admin` primitives
- eval fixtures
- policy and provenance ideas
- source-grounded synthesis patterns

Separate:

- runtime implementation
- release cadence
- deployment assumptions
- product surface

## 8. Recommendation

Start v0.10 with two parallel cuts:

1. Autonomy plus runtime pain: automatic memory decisions, exception-only review, CLI auth
   stability, and overview query budgets.
2. LLM substrate foundation: one provider layer, registry, validation, observability, and model
   settings shape.

This turns the post-v0.9 momentum into a real 1.0 path: less human review, fewer surprise logins,
faster pages, and a model/runtime substrate strong enough for automatic reflection and synthesis.
