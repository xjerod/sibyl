# Sibyl Phase 2 — Auth Migration Plan

Branch: `feat/surrealdb-driver-phase1` (assumes Phase 1 server-mode work has landed before Phase 2
begins).

Revision 3 — incorporates a repo-grounded review of the draft. Key corrections from Revision 2:
Phase 2 moves 14 auth/auth-adjacent tables plus 3 RBAC tables, not "13 auth tables"; RLS translation
must mirror the _actual_ five policy shapes in Alembic; the session-revocation design requires an
explicit `sid` rollout because access tokens do not carry `sid` today; the auth migration should sit
behind the existing `sibyl_core.auth` contracts instead of forking legacy-shaped logic; the auth
harness must compare normalized semantics rather than byte-equal responses; cleanup should preserve
historical Alembic revisions instead of rewriting them.

---

## TL;DR

Move Sibyl's 14 auth/auth-adjacent tables plus 3 RBAC tables off Postgres and onto SurrealDB in a
strict cutover, behind a flag. Keep Postgres alive and unchanged for non-auth consumers (crawler,
backups, raw captures, RAG, settings) — removing Postgres entirely is Phase 3, out of scope here.

---

## Context

Sibyl is a graph-backed knowledge + task system. Data layer has been moving off FalkorDB → SurrealDB
on `feat/surrealdb-driver-phase1`. Phase 1 migrated graph/entity storage to Surreal and introduced
Redis for jobs, locks, and pubsub. Postgres + FalkorDB are currently gated behind a `legacy`
docker-compose profile.

The immediate gap: `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/*` still reads and writes Postgres via
SQLAlchemy/asyncpg. All authed API endpoints fail when running surreal-mode dev without the legacy
profile because the auth path still opens Postgres sessions against `localhost:5433`, and
surreal-mode startup currently skips the legacy Postgres initialization that those paths still
depend on.

The deeper gap: auth is just one of several Postgres-dependent subsystems. Phase 2 narrows its scope
to auth; Phase 3 (separate plan, not written yet) will handle the rest.

---

## Scope — in and out

### In scope for Phase 2

**Auth/auth-adjacent tables (14):** `users`, `user_sessions`, `password_reset_tokens`,
`login_history`, `organizations`, `organization_members`, `organization_invitations`, `api_keys`,
`api_key_project_scopes`, `oauth_connections`, `device_authorization_requests`, `audit_logs`,
`teams`, `team_members`.

**RBAC tables (3):** `projects`, `project_members`, `team_projects` — these are the relational
source of truth for RBAC that `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/authorization.py` queries on every authed
request, and the sync layer `apps/api/src/sibyl/db/sync.py` treats them authoritatively. They move
together with auth.

**Access layer:** the existing backend-agnostic contracts in
`packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/auth/contracts.py`, the legacy adapters in
`apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/legacy/*`, `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/auth_runtime.py`
(currently a pure re-export), and the request-time consumers in
`apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/dependencies.py`, `rls.py`, `authorization.py`, `middleware.py`,
`api_keys.py`.

**Tooling:** extend `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/migrate/archive.py` and
`apps/api/src/sibyl/cli/migrate.py` with an auth payload and a scripted replay harness.

### Explicit non-goals (Phase 3 or later)

- `services/settings.py`, `routes/crawler.py` stats/health, `jobs/backup.py`, `routes/entities.py`
  raw captures, `services/document_search.py`, `persistence/legacy/rag.py` — these still need
  Postgres/SQLAlchemy/Alembic at the end of Phase 2.
- Removing asyncpg, SQLAlchemy, or Alembic.
- Removing the `postgres` service from `docker-compose.yml`.
- Migrating `DocumentChunk` + pgvector embeddings.
- Changing crypto (PBKDF2 iterations, JWT signature algorithm, cookie flags).
- Frontend changes — the web client already treats IDs as opaque strings.

### Auth namespace layout

Dedicated top-level Surreal namespace `sibyl_auth`, database `auth`. Rationale: users are global
(`apps/api/src/sibyl/db/models.py:91-156` — unique email + github_id are enforced across all orgs),
first-user-becomes-admin logic is global (`apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/users.py:27-32`), and users span
multiple orgs via memberships (`apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/legacy/auth.py:277-288`). Per-org
namespacing, which is correct for graph data, would fight the auth model.

Org-scoped auth tables (memberships, api_keys, invitations, audit_logs, etc.) live in the same
`sibyl_auth/auth` DB with `organization_id` columns; per-row org filtering is enforced by the
authorization layer, not by namespace isolation.

---

## Decision points — finalized

1. **Namespace layout**: dedicated top-level `sibyl_auth/auth`. Not per-org. (See above.)
2. **Projects/members/teams**: stay in dedicated Surreal tables. RBAC is relational in
   `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/authorization.py:69-291` and synced via
   `apps/api/src/sibyl/db/sync.py:42-164`; making the graph the source of truth is a separate
   redesign, not a store migration.
3. **DocumentChunk + embeddings**: parked for Phase 3. The Surreal driver schema at
   `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/backends/surreal/schema.py:24-143` currently
   bootstraps graph tables/edges only; there is no Surreal document schema, and RAG depends on
   pgvector + Postgres full-text over `DocumentChunk` (`apps/api/src/sibyl/db/models.py:1073-1129`,
   `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/services/document_search.py:161-233`).
4. **Cutover style**: strict archive-backed cutover with a brief write-freeze. **No production
   dual-write.** `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/auth_runtime.py:1-38` is a pure legacy re-export;
   auth flows already span writes across users/orgs/memberships/sessions/audit
   (`apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/legacy/auth.py:309-347,606-683`) with no cross-store transaction
   boundary. Dual-write would manufacture divergence, not safety.

---

## Pre-existing latent bugs — track independently

These are real bugs Codex surfaced while auditing the current auth code. They are not caused by
Phase 2, but Phase 2 must not make them worse and should ideally fix them in the process.

### Bug 1 — access-token revocation is a no-op

HTTP auth decodes JWTs without consulting session state
(`apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/dependencies.py:56-91`, `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/middleware.py:22-35`),
and WebSocket auth does the same (`apps/api/src/sibyl/api/websocket.py:309-320`).
`UserSession.revoked_at` is written on logout but never checked on subsequent access-token use. A
"revoked" user continues to authenticate until the JWT expires.

**Fix strategy:** add `sid` to newly issued access tokens, cache revoked sessions in Redis with TTL
tied to `refresh_token_expires_at`, and keep a temporary token-hash fallback for pre-`sid` access
tokens during rollout. Ties directly into Phase 2.3's session hot-path work.

### Bug 2 — RLS context gets silently dropped mid-request

`get_auth_session` sets transaction-local `set_config(..., true)` once per session
(`apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/rls.py:97-106,273-279`), but
`apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/users.py:153-154,201-202,243-244` commits mid-request. Subsequent
transactions in the same request run without RLS context, which on SELECT means returning empty rows
rather than erroring. Data-leak risk is low because `current_setting(..., true)` returns NULL on
mismatch, but availability is broken.

**Fix strategy:** either move away from ambient RLS entirely (which Phase 2.2 does), or wrap
`get_auth_session` in a per-request scope that reapplies `set_config` after each commit. Phase 2.2's
migration makes this moot for auth tables, but the non-auth tables using RLS need the same treatment
eventually.

---

## Phased plan

### Phase 2.0 — Unblock surreal-mode dev (half-day)

**Goal:** `moon run dev-surreal` boots a working stack while Phase 2 is in flight, without
pretending Postgres has been removed.

- Drop the `legacy` profile gate on `postgres` in `docker-compose.yml:56-74`. FalkorDB stays gated.
- Add `postgres` to the services list in `tools/dev/run-surreal-dev.sh:31-53`.
- Centralize the "legacy Postgres still required" startup path and call it from both
  `apps/api/src/sibyl/main.py` and `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/app.py` when auth or any remaining
  Postgres-backed subsystem is enabled, even when `SIBYL_STORE=surreal`. Today both startup paths
  skip pieces of PG init in surreal mode, which means even a running postgres container is not
  enough: migrations may not run and `services/settings.py` may never load.
- Verify startup produces a working `/api/auth/me` for a logged-in dev user.

**Exit:** contributors can pull the branch, run `moon run dev-surreal`, log in, and exercise authed
endpoints without manual compose juggling.

### Phase 2.1 — Surreal auth schema + repo layer, parallel (week 1)

**Goal:** a complete Surreal-backed implementation of the auth data layer, flagged off.

- Add a dedicated Surreal auth client/session helper. Do **not** overload
  `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/backends/surreal/driver.py` directly: that driver is
  group-id / graph oriented and assumes per-org namespace switching, while auth needs a fixed
  top-level namespace/database.
- New file `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/backends/surreal/auth_schema.py`. Define 17
  SCHEMAFULL tables: the 14 auth/auth-adjacent tables above plus `projects`, `project_members`, and
  `team_projects`. Keep stable UUIDs identical to Postgres IDs. Indexes:
  - UNIQUE on `users.email`, `users.github_id`, `organizations.slug`,
    `organization_invitations.token`, `password_reset_tokens.token_hash`,
    `device_authorization_requests.device_code_hash`, `device_authorization_requests.user_code`.
  - UNIQUE composite on `oauth_connections(provider, provider_user_id)`,
    `teams(organization_id, slug)`, `projects(organization_id, slug)`,
    `projects(organization_id, graph_project_id)`, `organization_members(organization_id, user_id)`,
    `team_members(team_id, user_id)`, `project_members(project_id, user_id)`,
    `team_projects(team_id, project_id)`, `api_key_project_scopes(api_key_id, project_id)`.
  - NON-UNIQUE on `api_keys.key_prefix` (auth intentionally queries all prefix matches then verifies
    hashes — `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/api_keys.py:106-130`).
  - Keep denormalized `organization_id` on `project_members` and `team_projects` for parity with the
    current schema and cheaper policy filters.
- Add `updated_at` to mutable records. Add `version` only where compare-and-swap semantics are
  required, starting with `user_sessions` and only extending further if a concrete concurrent-write
  path needs it.
- Implement Surreal repositories behind the existing `sibyl_core.auth` contracts (`UserRepository`,
  `OrganizationRepository`, `OrganizationMembershipRepository`, `SessionRepository`). Keep thin
  adapters in `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/surreal/` only where callers still expect the current
  function-style surfaces. This keeps the Wave 1 seams intact instead of cloning the legacy layer
  wholesale.
- New file `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/surreal/audit.py` implementing an append-only contract at
  the repo layer: the only exposed operation is `append(event)`; no update, no delete, no overwrite.
  Immutability moves from documentation (`apps/api/src/sibyl/db/models.py:364-408` claims it but
  `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/audit.py:23-44` doesn't enforce it) to compiled-in behavior.
- Extract shared auth/RBAC enums and DTOs out of `apps/api/src/sibyl/db/models.py` before cleanup.
  Today many non-ORM callers still import `OrganizationRole`, `ProjectRole`, `ProjectVisibility`,
  and `TeamRole` from that module.
- Environment flag `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE` (values: `postgres` default, `surreal`).
  `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/auth_runtime.py` becomes a dispatcher, not a re-export.
- Zero consumer flips yet. Unit-tested in isolation.

**Exit:** running with `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=postgres` is unchanged; running with
`SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal` against an ephemeral Surreal produces equivalent outcomes for a curated
battery of contract/repository tests.

### Phase 2.2 — RLS → application-layer authorization (week 1)

**Goal:** replace five distinct Postgres RLS policy shapes with explicit, testable application
checks.

The five shapes (derived from `apps/api/alembic/versions/0006_row_level_security.py:28-53,105-197`)
are:

1. **Org-scoped**: `organization_members`, `teams`, `projects`, `project_members`, `team_projects`,
   `audit_logs`, `organization_invitations`. (`crawl_sources` stays on the legacy Postgres path for
   Phase 3.)
2. **User-scoped**: `user_sessions`, `login_history`, `password_reset_tokens`, `oauth_connections`.
3. **User+org combined**: `api_keys`.
4. **Join-derived ownership**: e.g., `api_key_project_scopes` rows are visible iff the owning
   `api_key` row is visible.
5. **Pending-public / user-scoped hybrid**: `device_authorization_requests` are visible while
   pending and collapse back to user-scoped once approved or consumed.

Work:

- Replace `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/rls.py`'s ambient Postgres-session-variable model with explicit
  authorization helpers in `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/authorization.py`. One helper per policy shape,
  each taking `AuthContext` plus the row/query intent, returning either a filter predicate or a
  boolean authorization result.
- Rewrite `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/dependencies.py` and related consumers so request auth resolution
  comes from the runtime-backed repositories rather than direct SQLModel auth rows.
- Split today's `AuthSession` usage into "auth context" and "plain storage session" where
  appropriate. Auth-only routes should stop opening a Postgres session just to set RLS vars.
- Delete auth-specific `set_config` usage and `get_rls_session` / `apply_rls_from_auth_context` /
  `require_rls_session` wiring once no auth/RBAC route depends on them. Any remaining non-auth RLS
  usage becomes an explicit Phase 3 follow-up, not a hidden Phase 2 dependency.
- Rewrite the current ambient-RLS call sites in `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/tasks.py` and
  `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/users.py`.
- Simultaneously fix **latent bug 2** by removing the dependency on transaction-local RLS state
  across mid-request commits in `routes/users.py`.
- Add negative-case tests per policy shape: impersonate Org A, assert no Org B rows visible on
  reads/lists/joins.
- Add one integration test that exercises the full matrix (every route, two orgs, cross-org attempt)
  and asserts zero cross-org data leak.

**Exit:** no surface in `apps/api/src/sibyl/` reads `current_setting('app.user_id')` or
`current_setting('app.org_id')` for an auth-migrated table. Policies are enforced at the repo layer.

### Phase 2.3 — Concurrency + session hot path (week 2)

**Goal:** handle the hot path and concurrent-mutation cases that Postgres RLS + MVCC were implicitly
covering.

- Change token issuance first: mint a concrete session UUID before signing tokens, add `sid` to
  access tokens, and require `sid` on newly issued refresh tokens. Thread this through signup/login,
  org switch, invitation acceptance, device auth, and browser login flows. Today
  `create_access_token` has no `sid`, and initial refresh tokens are also minted without one.
- Session cache: Redis hash keyed by `session_id`, value
  `{user_id, org_id, revoked, refresh_token_expires_at}`. TTL = time-to-`refresh_token_expires_at`,
  **not** JWT exp. Reason: `UserSession.refresh_token_expires_at`
  (`apps/api/src/sibyl/db/models.py:331-340`, `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/sessions.py:104-115`,
  `apps/api/src/sibyl/api/routes/auth.py:957-1028`) is the authoritative session lifetime; caching
  to JWT exp would cause 30-day refresh cookies to 401 after one hour.
- Revocation path: `revoke_session` writes `revoked_at` in Surreal and sets `revoked=true` on the
  Redis entry. Access-token auth consults Redis by `sid` claim on every request; during the
  compatibility window for pre-`sid` access tokens, fall back to a short-lived
  `revoked_access_token:{sha256(token)}` entry keyed to the access-token expiry. This fixes **latent
  bug 1** without lying about legacy-token compatibility.
- `api_keys.last_used_at` flusher:
  - On auth, write `last_used_at` to Redis keyed by the resolved `api_key_id`.
  - A periodic arq task (every 60s) flushes pending entries via scoped SurrealQL
    `UPDATE api_key SET last_used_at = $ts WHERE uuid = $uuid` — field-scoped update only. **Never**
    full-record upsert (Surreal graph path uses delete+create,
    `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/surreal/ops/entity_node_ops.py:61-87`, which
    would resurrect revoked keys by clearing `revoked_at`).
  - Flusher skips records whose `revoked_at` is non-null at flush time (defense in depth).
- Refresh-token rotation concurrency:
  - `apps/api/src/sibyl/auth/sessions.py:117-141` replaces token hashes in place; three code paths
    trigger this today (refresh exchange at `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/legacy/auth.py:606-652`,
    org switch at `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/legacy/orgs.py:63-103`, invitation accept at
    `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/legacy/org_invitations.py:141-187`).
  - Migrate each to an optimistic CAS on `user_sessions.version`:
    `UPDATE user_session SET refresh_token_hash = $new, version = version + 1 WHERE uuid = $uuid AND version = $expected`.
    On version mismatch, retry once; on second mismatch, return
    `401 Session conflict, please re-authenticate`.
- Redis-backed locks (via existing `apps/api/src/sibyl/locks.py`) for first-user-admin bootstrap,
  signup-with-email-race, and OAuth account linking.

**Exit:** two concurrent refreshes on the same session produce exactly one new token pair + one
`401 Session conflict`; a revoked API key stops working within the next authenticated call (before
the next flush completes); `/api/auth/logout` invalidates newly issued `sid`-bearing access tokens
immediately and still catches pre-`sid` tokens during the compatibility window.

### Phase 2.4 — Auth archive + snapshot replay harness (week 2)

**Goal:** end-to-end export/import/verify tooling for auth, plus a scripted auth flow that must pass
against both stores before cutover.

This phase **replaces the Phase 2.4 "dual-write" slot from draft 1**. Dual-write is cut.

- Extend `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/migrate/archive.py:18-20,300-373` with an
  `auth.json` payload alongside `graph.json` and `postgres.sql`. Structure: one array per auth/RBAC
  table, records serialized with Surreal-compatible types and stable UUIDs.
- Add export logic in `apps/api/src/sibyl/cli/migrate.py` that dumps all 17 Phase 2 auth/RBAC tables
  from Postgres into `auth.json`.
- Add import logic that reads `auth.json` and bulk-inserts into Surreal via the new
  `persistence/surreal/` layer. Idempotent: re-running against a populated Surreal is a no-op.
- Extend the existing migration tooling rather than inventing a parallel cutover path.
  `tools/dev/migrate-auth-rehearsal.sh` can exist as a thin wrapper, but the source of truth should
  live in `apps/api/src/sibyl/cli/migrate.py`.
- New deterministic auth flow harness:
  1. Signup new user (email + password)
  2. Log in, obtain access + refresh tokens
  3. Refresh token exchange
  4. Create API key
  5. Authenticate with API key
  6. Revoke API key, verify next call fails
  7. Invite user to org, accept invitation
  8. Switch active org
  9. Device auth flow (request + approve + exchange)
  10. Logout, verify access token is rejected immediately (latent bug 1 regression guard)
  11. List user's sessions, verify correct
  12. Password reset request + consume
- Harness must pass against both `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=postgres` and `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal` with
  **normalized semantic equivalence**, not byte equality. Compare status codes, response shapes,
  role/scope behavior, decoded JWT claims (`sub`/`org`/`typ`/`sid` presence) after ignoring
  signature/`iat`/`exp`/`jti`, and observable side effects such as memberships, sessions, and
  revocations. Raw tokens, timestamps, and generated IDs are expected to differ.
- Verification addition to `apps/api/src/sibyl/cli/migrate.py:177-231,576-735`: before `cutover`
  succeeds, the harness must green for the target environment.

**Exit:** one command seeds a staging Surreal from a Postgres archive; one command runs the full
auth flow against either store; cutover is gated on a green run.

### Phase 2.5 — Cutover (week 3, single PR per environment)

**Goal:** flip the production flag with a defensible rollback story.

- `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal` becomes the deployment default. `postgres` retained as an escape hatch
  for exactly one release.
- Per environment:
  1. Announce write-freeze window (~5 minutes).
  2. Drain in-flight auth writes.
  3. Run the extended `sibyl migrate cutover` auth gate: archive auth from Postgres, verify row
     counts match (`users`, `organizations`, `organization_members`, `api_keys`, active
     `user_sessions`, RBAC tables), import to Surreal, run the Phase 2.4 harness, then flip the env
     flag.
  4. Unfreeze.
- **Explicit non-promise:** once Surreal accepts new auth writes, "flip reads back to Postgres" is
  not a real rollback. Doing so after N new signups have landed on Surreal produces divergence, not
  recovery. If cutover fails, the rollback is "restore Postgres from the pre-cutover archive, replay
  Surreal writes manually if any occurred, flip flag back before resuming traffic."
- Postgres auth/RBAC tables become read-only for one release (trigger-based write rejection, not
  just convention) so an accidental code path can't double-write.

**Exit:** prod runs `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal` for one release cycle with Postgres alive but
read-only on auth tables.

### Phase 2.6 — Auth-only cleanup (week 3-4)

**Goal:** remove the auth slice of Postgres. Nothing more.

- Delete: `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/legacy/auth.py`, `persistence/legacy/orgs.py`,
  `persistence/legacy/org_invitations.py`, `persistence/legacy/project_members.py`.
- Before removing auth SQLModel classes from `apps/api/src/sibyl/db/models.py`, move shared
  enums/value objects that non-auth code still imports into a non-ORM module and update imports.
- Preserve historical Alembic revisions as legacy history. Do **not** rewrite old migration files in
  place. Instead, add a new migration that drops the auth/RBAC tables and update docs to mark the
  older auth revisions as historical-only once Phase 2 is complete.
- Drop auth tables from Postgres via a new migration.
- Remove the `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=postgres` dispatch branch from
  `apps/api/src/sibyl/persistence/auth_runtime.py`. The flag becomes inert and is removed.
- **Keep:** `apps/api/src/sibyl/db/connection.py`, asyncpg, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, the `postgres`
  compose service, `services/settings.py`, `routes/crawler.py`, `jobs/backup.py`,
  `routes/entities.py` raw captures, `services/document_search.py`, `persistence/legacy/rag.py`.
  These stay until Phase 3.
- Update `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/sibyl/SKILL.md`, and the `sibyld db` subcommands to
  reflect that auth no longer lives in Postgres but non-auth state still does.
- Append rollout notes and deviations to this doc (or a short follow-up retro) after cutover, and
  capture any non-obvious learnings in Sibyl.

**Exit:** Sibyl's auth layer has no Postgres dependency. Non-auth Postgres dependencies are
untouched.

## Phase 3 — scope preview (not planned in this doc)

A follow-up phase must migrate the remaining Postgres consumers off SQLAlchemy before `asyncpg` /
`sqlalchemy` / `alembic` / the `postgres` compose service can be removed. The work roughly splits
into:

- `services/settings.py` → Surreal key-value table + Redis cache (hardest because of the
  double-checked locking and encryption paths at `services/settings.py:106-139`).
- `jobs/backup.py` + `BackupSettings`, `Backup` → Surreal records.
- `raw_captures` → Surreal records (probably co-located with graph entities).
- `crawl_sources`, `CrawledDocument` → Surreal with namespace scoping.
- `DocumentChunk` + embeddings → Surreal with HNSW vector index + BM25 fulltext (schema already
  exists in `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/backends/surreal/schema.py:24-143` for graph
  entities; extend to documents).
- RLS migration for the non-auth tables still using ambient RLS, if any remain after Phase 2.

Phase 3 is out of scope for this plan.

## Success criteria

- All auth and auth-adjacent routes work against `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal`, and their observable
  behavior matches `postgres` mode after the Phase 2.4 normalization rules are applied.
- Touched projects pass `moon run :check`, and targeted auth/migration suites are green in both
  `postgres` and `surreal` auth-store modes.
- Phase 2.5 cutover runs cleanly in a staging environment with a production-like dataset.
- The Wave 1 contract seams remain intact: no new direct storage access leaks out of persistence
  modules.
- One release cycle in prod on `SIBYL_AUTH_STORE=surreal` with Postgres auth tables read-only and
  zero auth-related incidents attributable to the migration.
- Phase 2.6 PR removes auth-only Postgres code without touching non-auth consumers.

---

## Out of plan, worth capturing separately

- Sibyl task: fix latent bug 1 — access-token revocation must consult session state (can be fixed
  standalone before Phase 2.3 if timing allows).
- Sibyl task: fix latent bug 2 — mid-request commits in `routes/users.py` drop RLS context on
  subsequent transactions. Narrow fix for non-auth tables; auth tables get fixed via the Phase 2.2
  rewrite.
- Sibyl task (informational): document in `docs/architecture/` that audit-log immutability is a
  repo-layer contract, not a DB-layer guarantee, and the invariant must be preserved in Phase 3 for
  any audit table that moves later.
