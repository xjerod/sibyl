# SurrealDB Graphiti Exit Inventory

Status: Wave 6 inventory baseline.

This document is hand-authored removal intent. The generated runtime source of truth remains
`docs/research/rust-port/INVENTORY.md`, and `moon run inventory-check` fails when a generated
Graphiti import is not classified here.

## Coverage Rule

Every generated Graphiti import path must appear as a backticked path in this document, except
`packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/surreal/ops/*`, which covers the Graphiti operation
adapter package as one named compatibility surface.

## Default Loop Position

- `remember`: raw capture, summarized `sibyl add`, API entity creation, and async create jobs write
  through native Surreal collaborators on the default path.
- `recall`, `context`, and `wake`: native retrieval runs through direct Surreal fulltext, raw
  recall, graph expansion, and native related-item hydration without importing Graphiti.
- `reflect`: persisted reflection sources and candidates write native graph records when
  `SIBYL_NATIVE_WRITE=enabled`. Review-mode raw candidate storage remains the explicit review path.
- Graphiti remains only in named compatibility, compare-mode, admin, and migration surfaces until
  their removal conditions below are met.
- `graphiti-core` is owned by the `sibyl-core[compatibility]` extra and the core dev dependency
  group. It is not a default `sibyl-core` runtime dependency.

## Legacy Projection Rule

Pre-v0.7 `Episodic` and `Entity` records are projectable into native retrieval only when scope can
be assigned without guessing. Records with project metadata, source ownership, or raw source links
inherit that project or owner scope. Historical records without recoverable ownership project as
`memory_scope = organization`, `principal_id = null`, and `source_id = graphiti:<episode_uuid>`.
Records without a recoverable source ID are excluded from native retrieval until a migration assigns
source metadata.

## Call Sites

### `apps/api/src/sibyl/jobs/entities.py`

- Verify: `moon run core:test -- tests/test_graph_client.py`.

### `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/entities.py`

- Behavior: entity CRUD, legacy `add_episode`, direct node save, and Graphiti hybrid search
  fallback.
- Default-loop usage: fallback for `add` and graph search; native context retrieval bypasses it in
  native mode.
- Status: fallback.
- Removal condition: native write, exact lookup, semantic search, and entity hydration cover the
  seeded graph behavior without Graphiti node APIs.
- Owner: v0.7 native memory.
- Verify: `moon run core:test -- tests/test_graph_entities.py`.

### `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/relationships.py`

- Behavior: relationship CRUD and edge hydration through Graphiti edge models.
- Default-loop usage: fallback for explicit graph relationship writes and reads.
- Status: fallback.
- Removal condition: native relation manager owns `relates_to`, `mentions`, and relationship model
  hydration.

### `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/search_interface.py`

- Default-loop usage: compare/fallback search scaffolding, not native retrieval's primary path.
- Status: retained compatibility adapter.
- Removal condition: compare mode no longer calls Graphiti search and seeded native retrieval is the
  default path.
- Owner: v0.7 native retrieval.
- Verify: `moon run core:test -- tests/graph/surreal/test_search_interface.py`.

### `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/cached_embedder.py`

  contracts.
- Default-loop usage: compatibility substrate beneath remaining Graphiti client paths.
- Status: retained compatibility adapter package.
- Removal condition: no default or fallback memory path constructs Graphiti or calls Graphiti model
  operation interfaces.
- Owner: v0.7 Graphiti exit.
- Verify: `moon run core:test -- tests/graph/surreal`.

### `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/tasks/workflow.py`

- Behavior: task workflow transitions and completion learning extraction links.
- Default-loop usage: task completion creates learning episodes and procedures with direct native
  writes, then links them through explicit native relationships and episode mentions.
- Status: native default loop.
- Removal condition: episode mention writes move fully behind the native relationship manager and no
  longer need Surreal driver compatibility helpers.
- Owner: v0.7 reflection.
- Verify: `moon run api:test -- tests/test_tasks_workflow.py`.

## Exit Gate

Wave 6 exits when generated inventory and this hand-authored inventory agree, native mode owns the
default `remember`, `recall`, `context`, `wake`, and `reflect` loops, and a no-Graphiti smoke test
blocks Graphiti imports for those flows.

## Dependency Boundary

Default `sibyl-core` installs do not depend on `graphiti-core`. Retained Graphiti code lives behind
the `compatibility` optional extra plus dev/test dependency groups so migration, admin, and
compatibility tests can still exercise the old contracts deliberately.

Dependency files:

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/pyproject.toml`
- `uv.lock`

Verify:

- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`
- `uv lock --check`

## No-Graphiti Smoke Plan

The import-blocking smoke test is now the default-loop proof alongside `moon run inventory-check`.
It starts a fresh Python process, blocks `graphiti_core` imports, and exercises native Surreal
memory writes, wake/recall context retrieval, related expansion, persisted reflection, CLI import,
MCP server construction, API job import, and prompt-hook import.

Smoke command:

- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`

Smoke file:

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_no_graphiti_default_loop.py`

Default-loop cases:

- `remember`: summarized remember/add writes native graph records.
- `recall`: native retrieval runs with `SIBYL_RETRIEVAL_MODE=native`.
- `context`: context packs and wake packs run through native retrieval and raw memory recall.
- `wake`: wake-layer context uses the same native context-pack path with wake limits.
- `reflect`: persisted reflection runs with `SIBYL_NATIVE_WRITE=enabled`.
- `entrypoints`: CLI, MCP, API job, and prompt-hook imports stay Graphiti-free.

Closure condition:

- The smoke test installs an import blocker for `graphiti_core`, exercises the five default-loop
  cases plus default entrypoints with native flags, and fails on any import or construction path
  that reaches Graphiti.
