# SurrealDB Graphiti Exit Inventory

Status: Wave 6 inventory baseline.

This document is hand-authored removal intent. The generated runtime source of truth remains
`docs/research/rust-port/INVENTORY.md`, and `moon run inventory-check` fails when a generated
Graphiti import is not classified here.

## A0 Baseline Receipt

Recorded on 2026-05-13 at local commit `1de0b408`.

- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`: generated inventory is current, 21
  Graphiti import files are covered here, inventory typecheck passed, and inventory tests reported
  14 passed.
- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`: 2 passed.
- `moon run :check`: 33 tasks completed, including 5 executed tasks and 28 cache hits. Core reported
  1327 passed and 15 skipped; API reported 1639 passed and 1 skipped; CLI reported 156 passed; web
  reported 88 passed.
- `graphiti-core` remains isolated to `sibyl-core[compatibility]` and the `sibyl-core` dev
  dependency group. It is absent from default `sibyl-core` runtime dependencies.
- Green remote receipts exist for `origin/main` at `d2d3d926`: CI run `25801942331`, docs deploy run
  `25801942466`, and scheduled nightly run `25791871706`. Local `main` is ahead of `origin/main`, so
  local gates are the receipt for the unpushed checkpoint.

## Coverage Rule

Every generated Graphiti import path must match the code allowlist in
`tools/inventory/runtime_surface.py` and appear as a backticked path in this document. A path that
is only documented here still fails the inventory gate unless the code allowlist classifies it. The
group `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/surreal/compat/ops/*` covers the Graphiti
operation adapter package as one named compatibility surface.

## Compatibility Allowlist

These are the only retained Graphiti import surfaces. Each entry has a machine-enforced class,
owner, and deletion or retention criterion.

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/backends/surreal/driver.py`
  - Class: `compatibility`
  - Owner: v0.7 Graphiti exit
  - Criteria: Graphiti client construction is deleted and native services own graph access.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/client.py`
  - Class: `compatibility`
  - Owner: v0.7 Graphiti exit
  - Criteria: Native graph client replaces Graphiti construction and provider adapters.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/entities.py`
  - Class: `compatibility`
  - Owner: v0.7 native memory
  - Criteria: Native write, exact lookup, semantic search, and entity hydration cover the seeded
    graph behavior without Graphiti node APIs.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/relationships.py`
  - Class: `compatibility`
  - Owner: v0.7 native write adapter
  - Criteria: Native relation manager owns relates_to, mentions, and relationship model hydration.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/search_interface.py`
  - Class: `compatibility`
  - Owner: v0.7 native retrieval
  - Criteria: Compare mode no longer calls Graphiti search and seeded native retrieval is the
    default path.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/cached_embedder.py`
  - Class: `compatibility`
  - Owner: v0.7 native retrieval
  - Criteria: Native embedding service owns caching without Graphiti embedder types.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/gemini_embedder.py`
  - Class: `compatibility`
  - Owner: v0.7 native retrieval
  - Criteria: Native embedding service supports Gemini directly.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/mock_llm.py`
  - Class: `test`
  - Owner: v0.7 reflection
  - Criteria: Native reflection tests no longer instantiate Graphiti extraction clients.
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/src/sibyl_core/graph/surreal/compat/ops/*`

  - Owner: v0.7 Graphiti exit
  - Criteria: No default or fallback memory path constructs Graphiti or calls Graphiti model
    operation interfaces.

## Compatibility Test Island

Default test tasks avoid collecting the named Graphiti compatibility files and skip mixed-file cases
marked `graphiti_compatibility`:

- `moon run core:test`
- `moon run api:test`
- `moon run :check`

The retained Graphiti test surface is opt-in:

- `moon run core:graphiti-compatibility-test`
- `moon run api:graphiti-compatibility-test`
- `moon run graphiti-compatibility-test`

Core compatibility tests:

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/graph/surreal`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_graph_batch.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_graph_client.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_graph_entities.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_graph_relationships.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_graph_runtime_services.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_log_safety.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_migrate_archive.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_search_interface.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_surreal_authentication.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_surreal_observability.py`

Core marked compatibility tests:

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_models.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_retrieval_advanced.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_tools_admin.py`
- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_tools_manage.py`

API compatibility tests:

- `apps/api/tests/test_communities.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_e2e_workflows.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_graph_communities_lod.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_graph_entities.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_graph_relationships.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_harness.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_legacy_graph_persistence.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_tools_core.py`

API marked compatibility tests:

- `apps/api/tests/test_cli_db.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_cli_export.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_models.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_settings_api_key_loading.py`
- `apps/api/tests/test_tools_manage.py`

These tests remain for archive, migration, graph admin, and compare/fallback coverage while the
default runtime continues moving to native Surreal surfaces.

## Default Loop Position

- `remember`: raw capture, summarized `sibyl add`, API entity creation, and async create jobs write
  through native Surreal collaborators on the default path.
- `recall`, `context`, `wake`, and `explore`: native retrieval and list/detail exploration run
  through direct Surreal fulltext, raw recall, graph expansion, and native related-item hydration
  without importing Graphiti.
- `temporal`: history, timeline, and conflict reads query native `relates_to` edges through the
  Surreal graph runtime without Graphiti edge ops.
- `health` and `stats`: org-scoped MCP health checks and graph stats count native Surreal entity
  records without entering the compatibility graph service.
- `manage`: task updates, task prioritization, dependency cycle detection, and source graph-linking
  orchestration bind native Surreal managers by default. Test-only compatibility factories can still
  be patched for legacy unit coverage.
- `link_graph` and crawler graph integration: document/entity linking creates document entities and
  `DOCUMENTED_IN` relationships through native Surreal managers by default.
- `reflect`: persisted reflection sources and candidates write native graph records by default. Set
  `SIBYL_NATIVE_WRITE=disabled` to use the compatibility path. Review-mode raw candidate storage
  remains the explicit review path.
- Graphiti remains only in named compatibility, compare-mode, admin, and migration surfaces until
  their removal conditions below are met.
- `graphiti-core` is owned by the `sibyl-core[compatibility]` extra and the core dev dependency
  group. It is not a default `sibyl-core` runtime dependency.

## Legacy Projection Rule

Pre-v0.7 `Episodic` and `Entity` records are projectable into native retrieval only when scope can
be assigned without guessing. Records with project metadata, source ownership, or raw source links
inherit that project or owner scope. Historical records without recoverable ownership project as
`memory_scope = organization`, `principal_id = null`, and `source_id = graphiti:<episode_uuid>`.
Records without a recoverable source ID are excluded from native retrieval until a migration assigns
source metadata.

## Exit Gate

Wave 6 exits when generated inventory and this hand-authored inventory agree, native mode owns the
default `remember`, `recall`, `context`, `wake`, `explore`, `temporal`, `health`, `manage`,
`link_graph`, and `reflect` loops, and a no-Graphiti smoke test blocks Graphiti imports for those
flows.

## Dependency Boundary

Default `sibyl-core` installs do not depend on `graphiti-core`. Retained Graphiti code lives behind
the `compatibility` optional extra plus dev/test dependency groups so migration, admin, and
compatibility tests can still exercise the old contracts deliberately.

Dependency files:

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/pyproject.toml`
- `uv.lock`

Verify:

- `moon run inventory-check inventory-typecheck inventory-test`
- `uv lock --check`

## No-Graphiti Smoke Plan

The import-blocking smoke test is now the default-loop proof alongside `moon run inventory-check`.
It starts a fresh Python process, blocks `graphiti_core` imports, and exercises native Surreal
memory writes, wake/recall context retrieval, related expansion, temporal history, health/stats,
manage task updates, prioritization, dependency cycle detection, document graph-link helpers,
persisted reflection, CLI import, default MCP tool-module imports, MCP server construction, API job
import, crawler graph-integration and pipeline imports, and prompt-hook import.

Smoke command:

- `moon run core:no-graphiti-smoke`

Smoke file:

- `packages/python/sibyl-core/tests/test_no_graphiti_default_loop.py`

Default-loop cases:

- `remember`: summarized remember/add writes native graph records.
- `recall`: native retrieval runs with `SIBYL_RETRIEVAL_MODE=native`.
- `context`: context packs and wake packs run through native retrieval and raw memory recall.
- `wake`: wake-layer context uses the same native context-pack path with wake limits.
- `explore`: native entity listing filters through direct Surreal manager reads.
- `temporal`: native relationship history reads source/target names from `relates_to`.
- `health/stats`: native graph health and entity counts run through the Surreal runtime.
- `manage`: native task updates, project prioritization, and dependency cycle detection run without
  Graphiti manager construction.
- `link_graph`: document graph-link helper writes document entities and relationships through native
  Surreal managers.
- `reflect`: persisted reflection runs natively by default, with `SIBYL_NATIVE_WRITE=disabled` as
  the named compatibility rollback.
- `entrypoints`: CLI, default MCP tool modules, MCP server construction, API job, and prompt-hook
  imports stay Graphiti-free, including crawler graph-integration and pipeline imports.

Closure condition:

- The smoke test installs an import blocker for `graphiti_core`, exercises the core default-loop
  cases plus native explore, temporal, health/stats, manage actions, document graph-link helpers,
  default entrypoints, and default MCP tool-module imports with native flags, and fails on any
  import or construction path that reaches Graphiti.
