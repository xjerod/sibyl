# Single-Host Deployment (Ansible)

Deploy the full Sibyl stack to one Linux host with the bundled Ansible role. Suited to a personal
instance on a small cloud VM: one box, no Kubernetes, modest cost.

## Architecture

Four containers, managed by a `sibyl.service` systemd unit:

| Container   | Source                                              | Purpose                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `surrealdb` | `surrealdb/surrealdb:v3.1.0`                        | Graph, content, and auth store |
| `backend`   | `ghcr.io/hyperb1iss/sibyl-api`                      | FastAPI + MCP server           |
| `frontend`  | `ghcr.io/hyperb1iss/sibyl-web`                      | Next.js web UI                 |
| `caddy`     | built from `caddy:2` with the Cloudflare DNS module | TLS + path routing             |

Caddy obtains a Let's Encrypt certificate over the Cloudflare DNS-01 challenge, so the host needs no
inbound HTTP or HTTPS from the public internet. Pair it with a private network (Tailscale,
WireGuard) and the instance stays unreachable except to you, while still serving a browser-trusted
certificate on a real domain.

The `backend` and `frontend` images are pulled pre-built from the registry, so nothing heavy
compiles on the host.

## The `sibyl` role

`infra/ansible/roles/sibyl/` provisions a host end to end:

- installs Docker Engine and the Compose plugin
- installs `ufw`: default-deny inbound, SSH allowed, HTTP and HTTPS reachable only on the proxy
  interface
- deploys the compose stack and a rendered `.env`
- runs the stack through a `sibyl.service` systemd unit

### Variables

| Variable                | Default                 | Purpose                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `sibyl_domain`          | `sibyl.hyperbliss.tech` | Hostname Caddy serves              |
| `sibyl_version`         | `1.0.0-rc.1`            | ghcr.io image tag                  |
| `sibyl_dir`             | `/opt/sibyl`            | Deployment directory               |
| `sibyl_proxy_interface` | `tailscale0`            | Interface HTTP/HTTPS is exposed on |
| `sibyl_mcp_auth_mode`   | `on`                    | MCP bearer-token enforcement       |

Secrets have no defaults and must be supplied, ideally through ansible-vault: `sibyl_jwt_secret`,
`sibyl_surreal_password`, `sibyl_openai_api_key`, `sibyl_anthropic_api_key`, `sibyl_cf_api_token`.
The role asserts each one is set before doing any work.

## Deploying

The role is provider-agnostic: any Ubuntu host reachable over SSH works.

### Prerequisites

The role is not published to Ansible Galaxy, so two things must be in place before the playbook runs
end to end:

- **`roles_path`** — your playbook has to resolve the `sibyl` role from a checkout of this
  repository. Point `ansible.cfg` at it:

  ```ini
  [defaults]
  roles_path = roles:/path/to/sibyl/infra/ansible/roles
  ```

- **Secrets** — the five vault variables listed under [Variables](#variables) have no defaults. The
  role asserts each one before it touches the host, so an unset secret aborts the run cleanly
  instead of leaving a half-built stack.

### 1. Inventory

Add the host to an inventory group:

```yaml
cloud:
  hosts:
    my-host:
      ansible_host: 203.0.113.10
      ansible_user: deploy
```

### 2. Bootstrap (once)

A fresh cloud host usually permits only `root`. Run a one-time play that creates your admin user and
authorizes its SSH key, so later runs connect as that user and host hardening can disable root SSH.

### 3. Provision

Apply the role, alongside a base-hardening role and optionally a Tailscale role, from your playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit my-host
```

The role is idempotent; re-run it to roll out config or image changes.

## Verifying

```bash
# on the host
systemctl status sibyl
docker compose --env-file /opt/sibyl/.env -f /opt/sibyl/docker-compose.yml ps
curl -sf https://<sibyl_domain>/api/health
```

## Operations

- **Logs:** `docker compose --env-file /opt/sibyl/.env -f /opt/sibyl/docker-compose.yml logs -f`
- **Update:** bump `sibyl_version` and re-run the role
- **Backups:** schedule `surreal export` against the running stack and copy the dump off-host. The
  graph is your memory; back it up.

## Reference

This project is deployed from a separate homelab Ansible repository that supplies the inventory, the
bootstrap play, ansible-vault secrets, and a Tailscale role. It is a worked example of the layout
above.
