# Sibyl

Sibyl gives you persistent memory across coding sessions. Search patterns, track tasks, capture
learnings—all stored in a knowledge graph.

## Agent Rules (READ FIRST)

These rules exist because real agent sessions consistently fail without them.

1. **NEVER redirect stderr OR hide errors behind a parser.** Do not append `2>/dev/null` to sibyl
   commands, and do not pipe `--json`/`-j` output straight into `jq`/`grep` without checking the
   exit code. On failure the CLI prints a human-readable `✗ <error>` line and exits non-zero; a
   blind `... -j | jq` swallows that line (jq aborts on the non-JSON text) and you retry blind.
   Capture the output first, check the exit code, then parse. Error messages contain diagnostic
   information you need; suppressing them causes silent failures and blind retry spirals.

2. **Link your project BEFORE doing anything else — this is a blocking gate.** Run `sibyl context`
   first. Use `sibyl context --quick` only as a local link/auth status check later in the same
   session, not as a replacement for full context or recall. If context shows `Project: none` or
   `Project: not linked`, resolve it before any recall/search/task command, in this order:
   (a) `sibyl project list` → if the project exists, `sibyl project link <project_id>`;
   (b) if `sibyl project relink` finds no candidate, `sibyl project create --name <dirname>` then
   link the new ID; (c) only if the user explicitly declined linking, use `--all-projects` and say
   so — it orphans memories from the project. `--project` takes a `project_xxx` ID, never a
   directory name. Links are cwd-scoped: a git worktree of a linked repo shows `Project: none` —
   relink there too. Unscoped recall returns cross-project noise; never treat unrelated hits as
   context. Use `sibyl skill get core` when you need to read this canonical skill contract instead
   of guessing a filesystem path.

3. **Always complete the retrieval pattern.** Search returns truncated previews. When you need
   details, follow up with `sibyl show <id>` using the ID from the search result. Working from
   truncated summaries leads to incomplete understanding.

4. **Capture learnings proactively.** When you solve something non-obvious, run `sibyl add` or use
   `--learnings` on task completion. Do not ask permission first—the whole point is building
   institutional memory.

5. **Check health before retrying, and follow the auth ladder.** If a command fails with a
   connection error, run `sibyl health` once. If the server is down, don't retry the same command —
   report it and move on. On `authentication_required` or `token_refresh_failed`: check
   `printenv SIBYL_AUTH_TOKEN`, run `sibyl auth status` once, and if it is not recoverable
   non-interactively, STOP treating memory as available — state in your final output that memory
   was unavailable and list any learnings that could not be captured. In a sandboxed environment,
   `sibyl context` succeeding (local cache) while recall/health cannot connect means blocked
   network egress, not a server outage.

6. **Never invent subcommands, flags, or enum values.** If you're unsure whether a command exists,
   run `sibyl <group> --help`. Do not guess, and do not pass any flag you have not seen in this
   document or in this session's `--help` output. Commands like `sibyl auth token` and
   `sibyl db backup` do not exist. After a context compaction, reload `sibyl skill get quick` (or
   re-check `--help`) before your first write verb — corrections learned earlier do not survive
   compaction, but wrong habits do.

7. **Guard shell-special content.** A memory body containing backticks, `$()`, or `<`/`>` must be
   passed via stdin (`echo ... | sibyl remember "Title" --kind ...`), a single-quoted heredoc, or
   `--content-file` — never as an inline double-quoted argument. Backticks inside double quotes
   execute as shell commands; this has re-run real build commands as a side effect of saving a
   memory. Run sibyl writes as standalone commands, never chained with `&&` after builds or tests.

8. **A failed write is lost knowledge.** A non-zero exit from `remember`/`add` means nothing was
   saved. Retry exactly once after applying the printed remediation; if it still fails, include the
   unsaved learning verbatim in your final message so the user can capture it. Never claim a memory
   was stored unless you can quote the returned entity ID (e.g. `error_pattern_5f40ca...`) as the
   receipt.

9. **Fetch IDs fresh.** Re-run the list command immediately before `show`/`update`/`complete`;
   never reuse an entity or task UUID remembered from earlier in a long session, and never run the
   list and its dependent show in the same parallel batch. `task show` accepts task IDs only —
   every other entity kind goes through `sibyl show <id>`. A `not_found` means re-list, not retry.

10. **Probe availability once (non-Claude hosts).** If `command -v sibyl` fails, note
    "sibyl unavailable in this environment — proceeding without memory" once and move on; do not
    re-derive absence per command. Expect recall/remember to take 1–10 s over the network — in
    harnesses with exec yield windows (e.g. Codex `exec_command`), use a generous yield
    (≥ 5000 ms) and poll the same session instead of re-running the command.

---

## Memory Interface Contract

Sibyl is the agent's durable brain. Use it as a loop, not a lookup box:

1. **Recall before acting.** Run `sibyl recall "<goal>" --intent <mode>` to get compact working
   memory: active work, decisions, plans, constraints, related graph context, and recent lessons.
2. **Act with context in hand.** Use recalled IDs for follow-up retrieval with `sibyl show <id>`
   when a preview is not enough. If a recalled/search item materially informs your answer or
   action, record that with `sibyl cite <id...>` or a `--cited` flag on the write you are making.
3. **Remember while learning.** Run `sibyl remember "Title" "What matters" --kind <type>` whenever
   future agents should not rediscover a decision, plan, idea, claim, artifact, session, procedure,
   or error pattern. In a linked repo, `remember` automatically scopes the memory to that project.
4. **Reflect at clean breakpoints.** Run `sibyl reflect "<raw notes>" --title "<session>"` to
   extract reviewable candidates. Add `--persist` to write candidates and preserve the raw session
   source as provenance. On task completion, still use `sibyl task complete --learnings "..."`.

**Perfect interface shape:** `recall -> act -> cite -> remember -> reflect`.

Prefer these verbs:

- `recall`: pull agent-ready working context before work.
- `remember`: store durable memory during or after work.
- `reflect`: convert raw session notes into decisions, plans, ideas, claims, artifacts, procedures,
  and session checkpoints.
- `search`: discover candidates when you do not yet know the goal shape.
- `show`: retrieve full source memory from a graph entity or raw memory ID.
- `cite`: mark only the memory that materially informed an answer, task completion, or reflection.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Check connection
sibyl health

# 2. Link your directory to a project (one-time, critical!)
sibyl project list                        # Find your project ID
sibyl project link proj_a1b2c3d4e5f6      # Link cwd to that project
sibyl context                             # Verify: should show your project

# 3. Now task commands auto-scope to your project
sibyl task list --status todo   # Only shows tasks for linked project

# 4. Search for knowledge
sibyl search "authentication patterns"

# 5. Get full content from a search result
sibyl show "episode:abc123-uuid-here"

# 6. Add a learning
sibyl add "Redis insight" "Connection pool must be >= concurrent requests"

# 7. Start a task
sibyl task start task_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# 8. Complete with learnings
sibyl task complete task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --learnings "OAuth tokens expire..."
```

**Pro tips:**

- **Link your project first** — then task commands just work without `--project`
- **Table output is default** — use `--json` only for scripting
- **Show is full fidelity** — use `sibyl show <id>` for complete content; don't use `--json` only to
  escape search-preview truncation
- Use `--all` flag to bypass context and see all projects

---

## The Agent Feedback Loop

```
1. SEARCH           -> sibyl search "topic"
2. RECALL           -> sibyl recall "goal" --intent build
3. RETRIEVE         -> sibyl show <id>  (get full content by ID from search)
4. CHECK TASKS      -> sibyl task list --status doing
5. CITE USED MEMORY -> sibyl cite "decision_abc raw_memory:source_123"
6. WORK & REMEMBER  -> sibyl remember "Title" "Decision, plan, idea, or learning..."
7. REFLECT          -> sibyl reflect "Raw session notes..." --title "Session" --persist
8. COMPLETE         -> sibyl task complete --learnings "..."
```

**Key insight:** Search shows IDs. Use `sibyl show <id>` to fetch full content.

## Core Commands

### Search - Find Knowledge by Meaning

```bash
# Semantic search across all types
sibyl search "error handling patterns"

# Search only graph memory when you want tasks, decisions, plans, episodes, or other saved context
sibyl search "surreal graph search" --graph-only

# Search only crawled documentation when you want external/reference docs
sibyl search "Next.js proxy" --docs-only

# Filter by entity type
sibyl search "OAuth" --type pattern

# Limit results
sibyl search "debugging redis" --limit 5

# Search across all projects (bypass context)
sibyl search "python guidance" --all
```

**Output includes:**

- Document name and source
- Section path (heading hierarchy)
- Content preview
- **Full entity ID** for retrieval

**Two-step retrieval pattern:**

```bash
# 1. Search to find relevant knowledge
sibyl search "redis connection pooling"
# Output shows full IDs like: guide:abe924cb-8cee-4cb5-...

# 2. Fetch full content by ID (copy from search output)
sibyl show "guide:abe924cb-8cee-4cb5-9dd1-818201c1c946"
```

**When to use:** Before implementing anything. Find existing patterns, past solutions, gotchas.

---

### Recall - Agent Working Context

```bash
# Get compact Markdown context before work
sibyl recall "ship the context graph" --intent build

# JSON for scripts and agent injectors
sibyl recall "plan the launch" --intent plan --json

# Cap the rendered markdown at roughly N tokens
sibyl recall "resume the migration" --budget 1200
```

Valid `--intent` values: `build, plan, ideate, research, review, debug, decide, learn, general`.
There is no `verify` or `audit` intent — verification work uses `review`. `recall` takes one quoted
GOAL; size the output with `--budget` (tokens) or `--limit` (items). There is no `--max-items`.

**When to use:** Before acting. This is the agent-ready working memory view. The Active Work section
is grounded in a direct status lookup, so in-flight tasks always lead it; completed work appears
under Prior Art with its learnings as the content.

---

### Brief - One-Shot Context for Subagents

```bash
# Lean wake-layer markdown, nothing else on stdout
sibyl brief "fix the parser crash" --budget 1500
```

**When to use:** When dispatching a worker or subagent. Run it as the parent and paste the output
into the worker's prompt. Workers that only need this do not need the full core skill pack — point
them at `sibyl skill get quick` instead.

---

### Context Pack - Structured Agent Context

```bash
# Markdown for agent injection
sibyl context pack "evaluate launch readiness" --intent plan --domain sibyl --markdown

# JSON for scripting against lean, agent-relevant item metadata
sibyl context pack "debug memory retrieval" --intent debug --json

# Full retrieval metadata per item (signals, ranks, policy fields)
sibyl context pack "debug memory retrieval" --intent debug --json --audit
```

**When to use:** When you need the structured context that hooks and agents consume directly. Item
metadata is a lean projection by default; pass `--audit` to inspect retrieval signals and policy
decisions when a pack looks noisy or wrong.

---

### Remember - Agent Memory Capture

```bash
# Capture decisions, plans, ideas, claims, artifacts, sessions, or learnings
sibyl remember "Use context packs" "Agents should receive grouped memory before building." --kind decision

# Scope by domain and link to existing graph entities
sibyl remember "Flow showcase concept" "Use aerial silk transitions..." --kind idea --domain "flow arts" --related-to domain_abc
sibyl remember "Worker routing decision" "Verifier agents run after non-trivial patches." --kind decision --task task_abc

# Override the linked project explicitly, or opt out of project scoping
sibyl remember "Venue decision" "Use runway layout..." --kind decision --project project_abc
sibyl remember "Global guide" "Always cite current docs..." --kind rule --all-projects

# Read the body from stdin
echo "Exact session notes..." | sibyl remember "Planning session" --kind session

# Read the body from a guarded file
sibyl remember "Planning session" --content-file ./notes.md --kind session
sibyl add "CSS diagnostic" --content-file ./snippet.css
```

`remember` has **no** `--title`, `--type`, or `--summary` flags — title and body are positional
(`sibyl remember "TITLE" "BODY" --kind <kind>`), with stdin, `--content`, or `--content-file` as
body alternatives. If a flag is rejected (exit 2), switch to the positional form — do not retry
flag variants. `--kind` values are snake_case; `gotcha` and `learning` are deprecated aliases that
remap to `error_pattern` and `note` with a warning (full 33-kind list: `sibyl remember --help`). whenever future agents should not have to rediscover a detail. Project
scoping stores both `metadata.project_id` and a project edge, and `remember` links to the single
active `doing` task when exactly one exists. Future recall can find the memory from structured
search, graph traversal, or task context. Use `--no-active-task` when the memory belongs to the
project but not the current task. `--content-file` rejects symlinks, non-UTF-8 content, and files
larger than 1 MiB by default; use `--max-size` or `--follow-symlinks` only when that is intentional.

---

### Reflect - Session Consolidation

```bash
# Preview reviewable memory candidates
sibyl reflect "We decided X. Next we will build Y." --title "Planning checkpoint"

# Persist extracted candidates and the raw source session into the graph
echo "Raw session notes..." | sibyl reflect --title "Build session" --intent build --persist --task task_abc

# Persist reflection and cite the memory that materially informed it
echo "Raw session notes..." | sibyl reflect --title "Build session" --persist --cited decision_abc,raw_memory:source_123

# Persist candidates only when the raw transcript should not be stored
echo "Raw session notes..." | sibyl reflect --title "Private checkpoint" --persist --no-source
```

**When to use:** At clean breakpoints, after ideation/planning/building, or before a long context
shift.

Persisted output shows the stored source ID when one exists, the candidate count, and each persisted
candidate ID. It links to the single active `doing` task when exactly one exists; use `--task` for
explicit task links or `--no-active-task` for project memory without task context. `--no-source`
skips storing the raw notes while keeping extracted candidates. `--cited` should name only the
memory IDs that materially shaped the reflection, not every item shown in context.

---

### Synthesis - Source-Grounded Artifacts

```bash
# Plan a synthesis from authorized memory (positional goal; no --intent flag)
sibyl synthesis plan "launch readiness brief" --type documentation --depth standard

# Draft a verified synthesis artifact (markdown by default; --format json for scripting)
sibyl synthesis draft "launch readiness brief" --audience "release team"

# Verify citations, freshness, redaction, and gap coverage (re-drafts internally
# from the same goal — it cannot verify a local file)
sibyl synthesis verify "launch readiness brief"

# Draft, verify, and persist the artifact into memory in one step
sibyl synthesis remember "launch readiness brief" --scope project
```

All four subcommands take the synthesis goal as a positional argument. Useful scoping flags:
`--project/-p`, `--all-projects`, `--domain/-d`, `--seed`, and comma-separated `--entity`,
`--decision`, `--task`, `--artifact` ID lists. There is no `--intent` and no `--content-file`
anywhere in this group.

**When to use:** When you need a cited, verifiable artifact built from memory rather than a raw
recall dump. `plan`/`draft`/`verify` mirror the
`synthesis_plan`/`synthesis_draft`/`synthesis_verify` MCP tools.

---

### Add - Quick Knowledge Capture

```bash
# Basic: title and content
sibyl add "Title" "What you learned..."

# With metadata
sibyl add "OAuth insight" "Token refresh timing..." -c authentication -l python

# Create a pattern instead of episode
sibyl add "Retry pattern" "Exponential backoff..." --type pattern
```

**When to use:** After discovering something non-obvious. Quick way to capture learnings.

---

### Task Management - Full Lifecycle

```bash
# CREATE a task (project auto-resolves from linked directory)
sibyl task create --title "Implement OAuth"
sibyl task create --title "Add rate limiting" --priority high --epic epic_a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use `--title` for the task name. Project auto-resolves from linked directory.

```bash
# List tasks (table output is default, comma-separated values supported)
sibyl task list --status todo,doing,blocked
sibyl task list --priority critical,high
sibyl task list --tags bug,urgent

# Filter by epic
sibyl task list --epic epic_a1b2c3d4e5f6       # Tasks in specific epic
sibyl task list --no-epic                # Tasks without any epic (orphaned/unplanned)

# Combine filters
sibyl task list --status todo --priority high --feature backend

# Semantic search within tasks (powerful!)
sibyl task list -q "authentication"   # Find tasks by meaning, not just text match

# Show task details
sibyl task show task_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Start working (generates branch name)
sibyl task start task_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Block with reason
sibyl task block task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --reason "Waiting on API keys"

# Resume blocked task
sibyl task unblock task_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Submit for review
sibyl task review task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --pr "github.com/.../pull/42"

# ⚠️ COMPLETE WITH LEARNINGS - always use this to finish tasks!
# This marks done AND creates a searchable episode in the knowledge graph
sibyl task complete task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --hours 4.5 --learnings "Token refresh needs..."
sibyl task complete task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --learnings-file ./writeup.md
sibyl task complete task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --learnings "Token refresh needs..." --cited decision_abc,raw_memory:source_123

# Archive single task
sibyl task archive task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --reason "Superseded by new approach"

# Direct update (use sparingly - prefer `complete --learnings` for finishing work)
sibyl task update task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --status done --priority high

# Add progress breadcrumbs, user clarifications, roadmap notes, or review context during work
sibyl task note task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 "Found the root cause"
sibyl task note task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 "Implemented fix" --assistant
sibyl task note task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --content-file ./diag.md

# List notes for a task
sibyl task notes task_a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

**Task States:** `backlog <-> todo <-> doing <-> blocked <-> review <-> done <-> archived`

---

### Project Management

```bash
# List all projects
sibyl project list

# Show project details
sibyl project show proj_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Create a project
sibyl project create --name "Auth System" --description "OAuth and JWT implementation"
```

---

### Epic Management (Feature Grouping)

Epics group related tasks into larger features or initiatives.

> **An epic is just a task with subtasks.** There is no separate Epic entity to manage: any task you
> hang children off of IS an epic, and its rolled-up status derives from its subtasks. The
> `sibyl epic` commands still work as sugar over this task tree. The `--complexity epic` flag is
> unrelated: it is only a task _size_ label and does not create or link anything.

```bash
sibyl epic list                                    # List epics
sibyl epic list --status in_progress               # Filter by status
sibyl epic create --title "Auth System"            # Create epic
sibyl epic show epic_a1b2c3d4e5f6                  # Show with progress
sibyl epic start epic_a1b2c3d4e5f6                 # Start epic
sibyl epic complete epic_a1b2c3d4e5f6              # Complete epic
sibyl epic archive epic_a1b2c3d4e5f6               # Archive epic
```

**Workflow:** create the parent (epic) → create tasks under it with `--epic <id>` → work tasks →
complete. `--complexity` sizes a task; `--epic` links it under a parent work item.

**Find tasks in an epic:** `sibyl task list --epic epic_a1b2c3d4e5f6`

---

### Project Context (Directory Linking)

Link directories to projects for automatic task scoping.

```bash
# First, find your project ID
sibyl project list

# Link current directory to a project
sibyl project link proj_a1b2c3d4e5f6     # Requires project ID

# Check current context
sibyl context

# List all directory-to-project links
sibyl project links

# Remove a link
sibyl project unlink
```

**One project per repo:** Each repository should link to exactly one Sibyl project. This enables
automatic task scoping without needing `--project` flags.

---

### Entity Operations - Generic CRUD

```bash
# List entities by type
sibyl entity list --type pattern
sibyl entity list --type episode

# Show entity details (use ID from search)
sibyl show epsd_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Create an entity (for capturing learnings)
sibyl entity create --type episode --name "Redis insight" --content "Discovered that..."

# Find related entities
sibyl entity related epsd_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Delete (immediate — there is NO confirmation prompt)
sibyl entity delete epsd_a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

**Common entity types:** episode, pattern, note, decision, plan, idea, claim, artifact, procedure,
error_pattern, session, task, epic, project, document, source (full 33-type set: run
`sibyl add --help`).

---

### Graph Exploration

```bash
# Find related entities (1-hop)
sibyl explore related ptrn_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Multi-hop traversal
sibyl explore traverse ptrn_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --depth 2

# Task dependency chain
sibyl explore dependencies task_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Project-wide dependencies
sibyl explore dependencies --project proj_a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

---

### Admin & Health

```bash
# Check system health
sibyl health

# Show statistics
sibyl stats

# Show configuration
sibyl config show
```

---

### Documentation & Sources

Sibyl can crawl and index external documentation for RAG search.

```bash
# List crawl sources
sibyl crawl list

# Add a documentation source
sibyl crawl add "https://docs.example.com" --name "Example Docs" --depth 2

# Start crawling
sibyl crawl ingest source_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Check crawl status
sibyl crawl status source_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# List crawled documents
sibyl crawl documents list --source source_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Read a crawled document
sibyl crawl documents show doc_a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

**Transcript ingestion:** Pull agent session history into memory with `sibyl ingest claude-code` or
`sibyl ingest codex`.

**Document collections:** Manage indexed documents directly with `sibyl docs add`,
`sibyl docs paste`, and `sibyl docs list` when you have content to index outside a crawl.

---

### Context Management

Contexts bundle server, org, and project settings. Useful for switching between environments.

```bash
# Show current context
sibyl context

# List all contexts
sibyl context list

# Create a named context
sibyl context create prod --server https://sibyl.example.com --org myorg --use

# Switch contexts
sibyl context use prod
```

---

### Server Logs & Debugging

Requires OWNER role. Useful when debugging graph issues or unexpected results.

```bash
# View recent logs
sibyl logs tail
sibyl logs tail -l error              # Filter by level
sibyl logs tail -s api -n 100         # Filter by service, more entries

# Search recent logs with your normal shell tools
sibyl logs tail -n 200 | rg "timeout"

# Inspect graph schema
sibyl debug schema

# Run read-only graph query
sibyl debug query "SELECT entity_type, count() AS count FROM entity GROUP BY entity_type;"

# System status
sibyl debug status
```

When SurrealDB is burning CPU but API logs are quiet, capture the container while the spike is
active:

```bash
tools/dev/surreal-container-snapshot.sh
tools/dev/surreal-container-snapshot.sh --seconds 10
```

The official SurrealDB image may not contain a shell. The snapshot script joins the container PID
namespace with a short-lived toolbox container, samples `/proc/1/task/*`, checks Docker stats,
probes `/health` and `RETURN 1`, and tails recent Surreal logs without restarting services.

---

### Entity History (Bi-Temporal)

Query how entities and their relationships changed over time.

```bash
# Full history of an entity
sibyl entity history entity_a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Point-in-time snapshot
sibyl entity history entity_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --as-of 2025-03-15

# Timeline view
sibyl entity history entity_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --mode timeline
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Session

```bash
# 1. Check current context
sibyl context

# 2. Check for in-progress work
sibyl task list --status doing

# 3. Or find todo tasks
sibyl task list --status todo

# 4. Start working
sibyl task start task_a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

### Research Before Implementation

```bash
sibyl search "what you're implementing" --type pattern
sibyl search "related topic" --type episode
sibyl search "common mistakes" --type episode

# Get full content from any result (use ID from search output)
sibyl show <id>
```

### Capture a Learning

```bash
sibyl add "Descriptive title" "What you learned and why it matters"
```

### Complete Task with Learnings

```bash
sibyl task complete task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --hours 4.5 --learnings "Key insight: The OAuth flow requires..."
```

---

## Migrating from FalkorDB + PostgreSQL

If a local install still has legacy FalkorDB + PostgreSQL data — typical signs are `moon run dev`
aborting with `⚠️  Local legacy data detected`, the Sibyl server unreachable, and writes piling up
in `~/.config/sibyl/pending_writes/` — follow the agent playbook in the migration pack
(`sibyl skill get migration`).

The playbook covers:

- Anchoring on commit `290b824b` (v0.6.0 — version-bumped but never tagged; `git tag` stops at
  `v0.4.1`).
- Bringing up legacy FalkorDB + Postgres on the real data volumes (the `_data`-suffixed ones are
  empty post-rename targets).
- Exporting from the v0.6.0 worktree, then importing through the current branch with
  `sibyld migrate import --source-type legacy-archive --target-mode surreal --yes --clean`.
- Two latent bugs you will hit:
  - The compose file's `:U` bind-mount flag is silently dropped under `podman compose`'s
    docker-compose plugin → SurrealDB fails to start with
    `Failed to create RocksDB directory: PermissionDenied`. Fix:
    `chmod 0777 .moon/cache/surreal-dev`.
  - `sibyld migrate verify` reports false-positive `missing imported episode` errors on legacy
    archives — the importer rekeys episodes to native Surreal record IDs while preserving the legacy
    ID in the `uuid` field. Verify counts directly via the SurrealDB `/sql` endpoint when this
    happens.

Do not auto-start `moon run dev` after migration — propose it; let the user run it. Sacred Boundary.

## Consolidating Personal Instances

When merging several current Surreal-backed Sibyl instances into a hosted canonical org, load the
migration playbook:

```bash
sibyl skill get migration
```

Use `sibyld migrate consolidate` to export sources with auth skipped, merge graph/content archives,
dry-run the hosted import, then add `--apply` only after the target dry run is clean. Preserve the
target auth surface; do not import personal-machine auth into a working hosted instance.

## Output Formats

- **Table** (default): Human-readable, clean output
- **JSON**: Add `--json` for scripting
- **CSV**: Add `--csv` for spreadsheet export

---

## Key Principles

1. **Search Before Implementing** — Always check for existing knowledge
2. **Project-First for Tasks** — Link your directory, then filter by project
3. **Capture Non-Obvious Learnings** — If it took time to figure out, save it
4. **Complete with Learnings** — Always capture insights when finishing tasks
5. **Use Entity Types Properly**:
   - `episode` — Temporal insights, debugging discoveries
   - `pattern` — Reusable coding patterns
   - `note` — Progress breadcrumbs, observations
   - `decision` — A choice made and its rationale
   - `plan` — Intended sequence of work
   - `idea` — A proposal or concept worth keeping
   - `claim` — An assertion to verify or cite
   - `artifact` — A produced output (synthesis, report, doc reference)
   - `procedure` — A repeatable how-to
   - `error_pattern` — A recurring failure and its fix
   - `session` — A consolidated session checkpoint
   - `task` — Work items with lifecycle
   - `document` — Crawled documentation pages

   These cover the `remember --kind <type>` values; run `sibyl add --help` for the full 33-type set.

## Concurrency & Locking

Sibyl uses distributed locks to prevent data corruption when multiple agents update the same entity
concurrently. This is important because graph operations and relationship updates can take 20+
seconds under load.

### How It Works

- **Entity updates and deletes acquire a lock** before modifying the graph
- **Lock TTL is 30 seconds** - automatically released if the process dies
- **Concurrent requests wait** up to 45 seconds for the lock to become available
- **409 Conflict** is returned if the lock cannot be acquired

### Handling Lock Conflicts

If you get a 409 error, the entity is being modified by another process. Simply retry:

```bash
# If this fails with "locked by another process"
sibyl task update task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --status doing

# Wait a moment and retry
sleep 2
sibyl task update task_a1b2c3d4e5f6 --status doing
```

### For Agents

When making API calls programmatically:

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def update_with_retry(task_id: str, updates: dict, max_retries: int = 3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = await client.patch(f"/api/tasks/{task_id}", json=updates)
        if response.status_code == 409:  # Locked
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
            continue
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    raise Exception(f"Failed to update {task_id} after {max_retries} retries")
```

### Valid Task Statuses

When updating task status, use these exact values:

- `backlog` - Future work, not committed
- `todo` - Committed to sprint
- `doing` - Active development (NOT `in_progress`)
- `blocked` - Waiting on something
- `review` - In code review
- `done` - Completed
- `archived` - Terminal state (no longer active)

**Common mistake:** Using `in_progress` instead of `doing`. The API will reject invalid status
values with a 422 validation error.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection errors

```bash
sibyl health
```

If unhealthy, the server or local data services are down. Do not retry commands blindly. Report it
and continue without Sibyl for this session.

### Task list shows wrong project's tasks

This happens when your directory is not linked to a project. All commands return global results.

```bash
sibyl context                      # Check — does it show your project?
sibyl project list                 # Find correct project ID
sibyl project link proj_xxx        # Link to correct project
sibyl context                      # Verify the link worked
```

### "Entity not found" after search returns results

Search results may reference entities by graph UUID. Use the exact ID from search output:

```bash
sibyl show "episode:abc123-full-uuid-here"
```

### "Failed to start task" with no details

Usually a lock conflict or invalid state transition. Check the task's current state:

```bash
sibyl task show task_a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

If it's already in `doing`, you don't need to start it. If locked, wait a few seconds and retry.

### Search returns results from other projects

Your directory is not linked. Run `sibyl context` — if `Project: none`, link it first.

## Common Pitfalls

| Wrong                               | Correct                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sibyl task add "..."`              | `sibyl task create --title "..."`                |
| `sibyl task list --todo`            | `sibyl task list --status todo`                  |
| `sibyl task create -t "..."`        | `sibyl task create --title "..."` (no `-t` flag) |
| `sibyl task update --learnings`     | `sibyl task complete <id> --learnings "..."` (!) |
| `sibyl task note` for completion    | `sibyl task complete <id> --learnings "..."` (!) |
| `sibyl add note "content..."`       | `sibyl add "Title" "content..." --type note`     |
| `sibyl search ... 2>/dev/null`      | `sibyl search ...` (never suppress stderr)       |
| `sibyl search ... \|\| true`        | `sibyl search ...` (let errors surface)          |
| `sibyl config`                      | `sibyl config show`                              |
| `sibyl auth token`                  | Not a real command — use `sibyl auth status`     |
| Using `--kind gotcha` or `learning` | Deprecated aliases — use `error_pattern`/`note`  |

### Notes vs Learnings

These are **different things** with different purposes:

| Command                                      | When          | Purpose              | Creates                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `sibyl task note <id> "..."`                 | During work   | Progress breadcrumbs | Note (task metadata)           |
| `sibyl task complete <id> --learnings "..."` | At completion | Capture insights     | Episode (searchable knowledge) |

Use task notes for in-flight observations, user clarifications, roadmap breadcrumbs, blockers, and
review context. Use `task update --description` when intentionally changing the canonical task
brief.

Use `--cited` on `task complete` when specific recalled/search memory materially informed the
completion or learning. Do not cite ambient context that did not affect the result.

**Wrong:** Using `task note` when completing a task **Right:** Using `task complete --learnings` -
this marks done AND creates a searchable episode

```bash
# WRONG - notes are for ongoing work, not completion
sibyl task update task_xxx --status done
sibyl task note task_xxx "What I learned..."

# RIGHT - complete with learnings does both
sibyl task complete task_xxx --learnings "What I learned..."
```

**Full task IDs are required** - always use the complete ID returned by list/search commands:

```bash
sibyl task show task_c24fc3228e7c  # Full ID required (17 chars)
```

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
sibyl init           # First-run setup (server, org, auth)
sibyl doctor         # Diagnose a broken local setup
sibyl health         # Check connectivity
sibyl context        # Confirm project and org context
sibyl auth status    # Check authentication
```

## MCP Tools (Programmatic Access)

When used as an MCP server, Sibyl exposes 11 tools. These are different from CLI commands.

| MCP Tool           | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search`           | Unified semantic search (graph + docs)                            |
| `context`          | Compile an agent context pack                                     |
| `synthesis_plan`   | Plan source-grounded synthesis from authorized memory             |
| `synthesis_draft`  | Draft + verify + optionally remember a synthesis artifact         |
| `synthesis_verify` | Verify citation/freshness/hidden-context/gap coverage             |
| `explore`          | Browse graph: list, related, traverse, deps                       |
| `add`              | Add knowledge, tasks, or projects                                 |
| `remember`         | Capture durable memory: decision/plan/idea/claim/artifact/session |
| `reflect`          | Convert raw notes into reviewable memory candidates               |
| `manage`           | Task lifecycle, source ops, analysis, admin                       |
| `logs`             | View server logs (OWNER role required)                            |

The `manage` tool accepts an `action` parameter. Task actions: `start_task`, `block_task`,
`unblock_task`, `submit_review`, `complete_task`, `archive_task`, `update_task`, `add_note`. Epic
actions: `start_epic`, `complete_epic`, `archive_epic`, `update_epic`. Source actions: `crawl`,
`sync`, `refresh`, `link_graph`, `link_graph_status`. Analysis actions: `estimate`, `prioritize`,
`detect_cycles`, `suggest`. Server health and graph statistics are not `manage` actions — they are
the `sibyl://health` and `sibyl://stats` MCP resources.
